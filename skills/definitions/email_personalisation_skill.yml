            Hi Tom,

            Love your late-night electronic sessions - the Burial retrospective last week was brilliant.

            I'm working with sadact on 'Midnight Drive' – a late-night ambient piece that sits somewhere between Boards of Canada and Jon Hopkins. BBC Introducing featured it last month and it's had solid response (50k streams, Amazing Radio added it to rotation).

            The UK electronic influence feels like a natural fit for your show, especially with the British engineer collaboration angle.

            Would love to hear your thoughts if you get a sec to check it out.

            Best,
            Chris
