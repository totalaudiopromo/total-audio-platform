## Competitive Cost Comparison

### Total Audio Promo vs Competitors (Liberty Scale)

| Tool | Annual Cost | Music-Specific | Time Savings | Net Benefit | ROI |
|------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|-----|
| **Muck Rack** | £11,700-£39,000 | ❌ Generic PR | Moderate | £98,700-£126,000 | 843-1,078% |
| **Cision** | £20,000-£46,800 | ❌ Generic PR | Moderate | £90,900-£117,700 | 454-589% |
| **Propel** | £3,000-£5,000 | ❌ Generic PR | Low | £63,850-£65,850 | 2,128-2,195% |
| **Total Audio Promo** | £12,000 | ✅ Music-specific | High | £125,700 | 1,048% |
| **DIY (Spreadsheets)** | £0 (time cost high) | N/A | None | £0 | N/A |

**Analysis:**

**Muck Rack:**
- Higher cost (up to £39,000/year)
- Generic PR focus (not optimised for music workflow)
- Still requires manual music industry contact research
- Liberty saves less with Muck Rack than with TAP

**Cision:**
- Highest cost (up to £46,800/year)
- Corporate PR focus (press releases, newswires)
- Music PR agencies don't use newswire distribution
- Overkill for Liberty's needs

**Propel:**
- Lowest cost (£3,000-£5,000/year)
- But generic PR - no BBC Radio specialisation
- Liberty still spends 15 hours on contact research per campaign
- Lower time savings = lower total value despite lower cost

**Total Audio Promo:**
- Mid-market pricing (£12,000/year)
- Music-specific = maximum time savings
- Best ROI of paid options (1,048%)
- **Optimal cost-benefit balance for Liberty**

## Sensitivity Analysis

### What if Liberty's Assumptions Are Wrong?

**Variable 1: Campaign Volume**

| Campaigns/Month | Annual Time Saved | Annual Value | Annual Cost | Net Benefit | ROI |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| **5** | 2,295 hours | £68,850 | £6,000 | £62,850 | 1,048% |
| **10** | 4,590 hours | £137,700 | £12,000 | £125,700 | 1,048% |
| **15** | 6,885 hours | £206,550 | £18,000 | £188,550 | 1,048% |
| **20** | 9,180 hours | £275,400 | £24,000 | £251,400 | 1,048% |

**Insight:** ROI remains constant at 1,048% regardless of campaign volume (pricing scales with usage)

---

**Variable 2: Freelancer Rate**

| Freelancer Rate | Annual Value (10 campaigns/month) | Annual Cost | Net Benefit | ROI |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| **£20/hour** | £91,800 | £12,000 | £79,800 | 665% |
| **£30/hour** | £137,700 | £12,000 | £125,700 | 1,048% |
| **£40/hour** | £183,600 | £12,000 | £171,600 | 1,430% |
| **£50/hour** | £229,500 | £12,000 | £217,500 | 1,813% |

**Insight:** Higher-paid team = higher value from time savings. If Liberty uses senior publicists (£40-50/hour), ROI is even better.

---

**Variable 3: Time Savings Accuracy**

| Actual Time Saved | Annual Value | Annual Cost | Net Benefit | ROI |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| **50% of estimate** | £68,850 | £12,000 | £56,850 | 474% |
| **75% of estimate** | £103,275 | £12,000 | £91,275 | 761% |
| **100% of estimate** | £137,700 | £12,000 | £125,700 | 1,048% |
| **125% of estimate** | £172,125 | £12,000 | £160,125 | 1,334% |

**Insight:** Even if time savings are only 50% of estimate, ROI is still 474% - highly attractive investment.

## Risk-Adjusted ROI

### Conservative Estimate (Worst-Case Scenario)

**Assumptions:**
- Only 50% of estimated time savings realised (implementation friction, learning curve)
- £40/hour blended rate (conservative high estimate)
- £2,000/month cost (highest tier)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Time saved** | 2,295 hours/year (50% of 4,590) |
| **Value of time saved** | £91,800/year |
| **Total Audio Promo cost** | £24,000/year |
| **Net benefit** | £67,800/year |
| **ROI** | 283% |

**Conclusion:** Even in worst-case scenario, ROI is 283% - still highly attractive.

---

## Pilot Program ROI

### 4-Week Pilot (2 Campaigns)

**Assumptions:**
- 2 campaigns over 4 weeks
- Discounted pilot rate: £500/month
- Full time savings realised (learning curve minimal due to intuitive design)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Time saved (2 campaigns)** | 77.4 hours |
| **Value of time saved** | £2,325 (at £30/hour) |
| **Pilot cost** | £500 |
| **Net benefit** | £1,825 |
| **ROI** | 365% |
| **Payback period** | 6.5 days |

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Low upfront commitment (£500 for 4 weeks)
- Real-world testing in Liberty's workflow
- If doesn't work, only £500 at risk
- If works, £1,825 net benefit in first month alone

---

## Client Value Impact (Indirect ROI)

### How Time Savings Improve Client Outcomes

**Scenario: Liberty Uses Saved Time for Better Relationship Building**

**Current State:**
- 15 hours contact research + 2.5 hours pitch writing = 17.5 hours admin per campaign
- Limited time for relationship nurturing (phone calls, face-to-face meetings)

**With Total Audio Promo:**
- 30 seconds contact research + 15 min pitch writing = ~15 minutes admin
- **17+ hours freed for relationship building**

**Impact on Client Results:**
- More time with Jack Saunders, Clara Amfo, key presenters = stronger relationships
- Stronger relationships = more placements
- More placements = happier clients
- Happier clients = higher retention, referrals, upsells

**Value:**
- Client lifetime value increase (difficult to quantify, but significant)
- Reduced churn (retaining 1 client worth £24,000/year = 2x TAP cost)
- Referral revenue (satisfied clients refer new clients)

## Appendix: ROI Calculation Formulas

### Time Savings Calculation

```
Time Saved per Campaign = (Current Time - New Time)
Value per Campaign = Time Saved × Hourly Rate
Monthly Value = Value per Campaign × Campaigns per Month
Annual Value = Monthly Value × 12
```

### ROI Calculation

```
ROI = (Net Benefit / Investment) × 100
Net Benefit = (Time Saved Value) - (TAP Cost)
Investment = TAP Annual Cost
```

### Payback Period Calculation

```
Payback Period (months) = Investment / Monthly Net Benefit
Monthly Net Benefit = Monthly Value Saved - Monthly TAP Cost
```

### Break-Even Calculation

```
Break-Even Campaigns = Annual TAP Cost / Value per Campaign
```
