# Genspark Prompt: Liberty Music PR Pitch Deck - Full Tone Calibration

**USE THIS PROMPT WITH GENSPARK** to apply British casual-professional tone across ALL slides.

---

## PROMPT FOR GENSPARK

```
I need you to revise the entire Liberty Music PR pitch deck (all 10 slides) to match the production aesthetic and British casual-professional tone from intel.totalaudiopromo.com.

CRITICAL PROBLEM: The current deck is too bold/brash (American sales pitch) and doesn't match the founder's authentic voice.

PRODUCTION CONTEXT:
- **Founder**: Chris Schofield, 5+ years radio promotion experience
- **Voice**: British casual-professional ("Right, so...", "tbh", "if you get a sec")
- **NOT**: American corporate sales tactics ("YOU NEED THIS NOW!", giant red warnings)
- **Production sites**: intel.totalaudiopromo.com, pitch.totalaudiopromo.com, tracker.totalaudiopromo.com
- **Verified colours**: Audio Intel (#2563EB), Pitch Generator (#F59E0B), Campaign Tracker (#14B8A6)

PRODUCTION DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS (from live sites):
- **Border radius**: 0.75rem (rounded-xl) for cards/boxes, 9999px (rounded-full) for badges
- **Border widths**: 2px standard, 4px for hero elements only, 6px for top accent bars
- **Shadows**: 4px 4px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.1) standard, 6px 6px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.15) for emphasis
- **Typography**: font-sans (system stack), font-black (900) for display, font-bold (700) for headings, font-semibold (600) for body
- **Colour treatment**: Softer tints (#DBEAFE, #FEF3C7, #CCFBF1) for backgrounds, not harsh primary colours everywhere

REQUIRED TONE SHIFT ACROSS ALL SLIDES:
- **From**: Aggressive, accusatory, "YOU'RE FAILING" energy
- **To**: Consultative, friendly, "here's the industry reality" approach
- **Voice**: "Right, so... here's what we've built" (British casual-professional)
- **NOT**: "YOU NEED THIS NOW!" (American sales tactics)

---

## SLIDE-BY-SLIDE REVISIONS

### Slide 1: Title Slide
✅ **Already good** - "Live Demo for Liberty Music PR Radio Team" is friendly and specific

**Keep**:
- Clear, specific audience targeting
- Production colour badges (blue, amber, teal)
- Friendly professional tone

**Minor visual adjustments**:
- Ensure rounded corners (0.75rem) on title card and badges
- Soften shadow (6px 6px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.15))

---

### Slide 2: Problem Statement
**Current**: "THE LIBERTY REALITY: LAST CAMPAIGN VS NEXT CAMPAIGN" (too dramatic)

**Revise to**: "Before and after: How your workflow could change"

**Visual changes**:
- Reduce heading size from all-caps aggressive to Title Case friendly
- Change red warning icons (⚠️) to softer amber colour (#F59E0B)
- Add rounded corners (0.75rem) to problem/solution boxes
- Soften shadows from harsh black to rgba(0,0,0,0.1)

**Tone changes**:
- Frame as observation, not accusation
- Keep the side-by-side comparison (works well)
- Soften "Let's test that on Liberty's next 2-3 radio campaigns" to "We could test this on Liberty's next 2-3 campaigns (radio team picks which ones)"

---

### Slide 3: Cost Analysis
**Current**: "WHAT THIS COSTS YOU RIGHT NOW" + giant red "£2,212-£4,425/MONTH WASTED"

**Revise to**: "The hidden cost of manual research"

**MAJOR visual changes**:
- Reduce number size by 40%: 64px (down from ~100px)
- Change colour from red (#DC2626) to amber (#F59E0B)
- Change background from white+red border to light amber tint (#FEF3C7)
- Border: 2px amber top accent, 2px grey (#E5E7EB) sides/bottom
- Border radius: 0.75rem (rounded corners)
- Shadow: 6px 6px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.15) (softer than current)

**Typography changes**:
- Headline: "The hidden cost of manual research" (32px font-bold, not all-caps)
- Number: £2,212-£4,425/MONTH (64px font-black, amber colour)
- Subtext: "Based on typical UK freelancer rates" (18px font-semibold)
- Keep disclaimer: "Example calculation. We'll measure your actual ROI during the pilot based on your real numbers." (14px font-medium italic, grey #6B7280)

**Tone changes**:
- Frame as industry reality, not personal failure
- Add context around number (not just screaming figure)
- Change "Typical freelancer rate: £30/hour (adjust for your actual team costs)" to be more consultative
- Keep "Real costs beyond time" section - this is good strategic framing

---

### Slide 4: The Suite
**Current**: "THE SUITE: UNIFIED WORKFLOW" (feels like feature dumping)

**Revise to**: "How the three apps work together"

**Visual changes**:
- Soften card borders: 2px standard (not 4-6px)
- Rounded corners: 0.75rem on all cards
- Shadows: 4px 4px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.1) (softer)
- Use softer background tints:
  - Audio Intel: #DBEAFE (light blue)
  - Pitch Generator: #FEF3C7 (light amber)
  - Campaign Tracker: #CCFBF1 (light teal)

**Tone changes**:
- Change "Time saved: 5 hours/week → 30 minutes" to "Typical time saving: ~5 hours/week → ~30 minutes"
- Add context about workflow integration, not just feature lists
- Soften "Radio team chooses which campaigns to test these tools on" to feel more collaborative

---

### Slide 5: Workflow
**Current**: "HOW IT WORKS: CAMPAIGN KICKOFF TO RESULTS" (clinical)

**Revise to**: "From contact list to coverage: A typical campaign flow"

**Visual changes**:
- Rounded corners on all workflow boxes (0.75rem)
- Softer numbered circles: 2px border, subtle shadow
- Change "90 seconds each" badge to "~90 seconds average" (less overly specific)
- Reduce visual weight of timeline connector

**Tone changes**:
- Frame as example, not promise: "Typical time comparison (50 contacts)" instead of absolute claim
- Add qualifier to "TIME SAVED: 90%" → "TYPICAL TIME SAVING: ~90%"
- Keep "Live demo of contact enrichment during presentation" (good transparency)

---

### Slide 6: Results
**Current**: "REAL RESULTS FROM LIVE CAMPAIGNS" (feels like marketing hype)

**Revise to**: "Results from testing: Real UK radio contacts"

**Visual changes**:
- Soften pill/badge borders: 2px (not 3-4px)
- Rounded corners: 9999px (rounded-full) for pills
- Use teal (#14B8A6) for success indicators (not bright green)
- Lighten shadows on before/after comparison boxes

**Tone changes**:
- "99%+ success rate with major BBC/Spotify contacts" → "99%+ success rate in testing with major BBC/Spotify contacts"
- Keep disclaimer: "Example from UK radio promotion workflows (contact data is illustrative; no personal emails shown)"
- The before/after comparison is excellent - keep this visual storytelling

---

### Slide 7: ROI
**Current**: Giant "453% ROI" (feels like infomercial)

**Visual changes**:
- Reduce "453%" size by 30%: 72px (down from ~100px)
- Change background from white to light teal tint (#CCFBF1)
- Border: 2px teal top accent, 2px grey sides/bottom
- Border radius: 0.75rem
- Shadow: 6px 6px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)

**Tone changes**:
- Keep the disclaimer (perfect): "Example calculation. We'll measure your actual ROI during the pilot."
- Add qualifier to breakdown: "Time saved per campaign: ~14.75 hours × £30 = ~£442.50 value"
- Frame as illustrative example, not guaranteed outcome

---

### Slide 8: Pilot Structure
**Current**: "RADIO TEAM PILOT → FOUNDING PARTNER PATH" (transactional)

**Revise to**: "Proposed pilot approach: Three phases"

**Visual changes**:
- Soften phase card borders: 2px standard
- Rounded corners: 0.75rem on all phase cards
- Use softer background tints:
  - Phase 1 (FREE): #CCFBF1 (light teal)
  - Phase 2 (£200): #DBEAFE (light blue)

- Lighten shadows: 4px 4px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)

**Tone changes**:
- Keep "3× YES? ✓ ✓ ✓ → GO" (this is actually charming and honest)
- Keep "If any NO → Walk away, no payment" (builds trust)
- Add: "If 2/3 YES, we'll discuss custom solution that addresses the remaining concern" (shows flexibility)

---

### Slide 9: Benefits
**Current**: "WHAT THIS MEANS FOR LIBERTY" (corporate)

**Revise to**: "What this could mean for Liberty's workflow"

- Use app-specific colour accents:
  - Time: Blue (#DBEAFE)
  - Reporting: Teal (#CCFBF1)
  - Scale: Amber (#FEF3C7)
  - Analytics: Light grey (#E5E7EB)

**Tone changes**:
- Keep the BRILLIANT final line: "This isn't about saving money—it's about winning more renewals and taking on bigger artists."
- This is the perfect tone - apply this energy to earlier slides too!

---

### Slide 10: Timeline
✅ **Already good tone** - "FROM DEMO TO RADIO TEAM PILOT" is clear and friendly

**Visual changes**:
- Ensure rounded corners (0.75rem) on timeline boxes
- Soften shadows: 4px 4px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)
- Lighten contact card border at bottom: 2px blue accent

**Tone changes**:
- Keep "Binary decision: all YES = continue, any NO = walk away" (honest and low-pressure)

4. **Typography**:

   - Subheadings: 18-24px font-semibold (600)
   - Body: 16px font-medium (500)
