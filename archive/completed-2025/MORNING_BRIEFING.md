   - "Can you share 5 contacts you need to research?"

**Booking Link Location**:

5. **CTA**: Try Audio Intel with 10 free enrichments

**Tone**: Helpful industry insider, not sales pitch

---

## 🚫 WHAT NOT TO DO TODAY

- ❌ Don't debug any infrastructure (MCP, OAuth, APIs)
- ❌ Don't write more content (43 pieces is enough)
- ❌ Don't build new features (product is ready)
- ❌ Don't optimize existing code (focus on customers)
- ❌ Don't research more marketing strategies (execute current plan)

**Rule**: If it's not directly acquiring a customer, it's a distraction today.

## 💬 MESSAGING CHEAT SHEET (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Radio Promoter Outreach Template

```
Subject: Fellow radio promoter - 15 hours → 3 minutes

Hi [Name],

Chris here - I'm a radio promoter (5+ years, pitched to BBC Radio 6 Music,
Amazing Radio, regional stations) and producer (sadact).

Spotted your work with [artist/campaign]. Impressive results.

Quick question: How much time are you spending on contact research per campaign?

I was spending 15+ hours researching, verifying, and organizing station contacts.
Built a tool that cut it to 3 minutes. Thought you might find it useful.

Happy to show you with 5 of your actual contacts (takes 2 minutes).

No sales pitch - just built something that solved my own research nightmare.

Here's my calendar if you're interested: [booking link]

Chris
Brighton, UK

### Demo Call Opening Script

```
"Right, so I'm Chris - producer (sadact) and I've been doing radio promotion
for 5+ years. Pitched to BBC Radio 6 Music, Amazing Radio, loads of regional
stations. Built Audio Intel because I was wasting 15+ hours per campaign on
contact research.

What I'd love to do is show you how it works with 5 of your actual contacts.
Takes about 2 minutes to process them, then we can see if it's useful for you.

Do you have 5 contacts handy? Can be any format - spreadsheet, notes app,
even just station names."
```

### Social Media Bio Update
