# Demo Preparation Checklist

Use this template before any customer demo.

## Pre-Demo Checks (30 mins before)

### 1. Audio Intel Smoke Test

- [ ] Can log in to <https://intel.totalaudiopromo.com>
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] Can perform a test enrichment (use test contact)
- [ ] Results display correctly
- [ ] Export/download works

### 2. Demo Data Preparation

- [ ] Have 5-10 prospect contacts ready (real ones from their industry if possible)
- [ ] Test enrichment on 2-3 contacts beforehand
- [ ] Note any interesting results to highlight
- [ ] Have backup contacts if their list is empty

### 3. Story Framing

**Opening (30 seconds):**
"I built this because I was spending 15+ hours per campaign researching contacts. Let me show you what it does."

**Core demo (3-5 minutes):**

1. Paste their contacts
2. Run enrichment
3. Show results
4. Calculate time saved: [contacts] × 15 mins = X hours saved

**Close:**
"Questions? Want to try it with your own list?"

### 4. Failure Contingency

If enrichment is slow or fails:

- "Let me show you a previous result while this processes"
- Have screenshots of successful enrichments ready
- Acknowledge: "Still tuning the speed - currently takes ~30 seconds per contact"

### 5. Post-Demo

- [ ] Log in CUSTOMER_OUTREACH_LOG.md
- [ ] Note any feature requests or objections
- [ ] Schedule follow-up within 48 hours
- [ ] Update demo script based on what worked
