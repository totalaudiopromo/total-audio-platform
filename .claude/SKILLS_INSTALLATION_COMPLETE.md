# Claude Code Skills - Installation Complete

**Installation Date:** October 22, 2025
**Installation Status:** **COMPLETE**
**Locations:**

- `~/.claude/skills/` (global)
- `~/workspace/active/total-audio-platform/.claude/skills/` (project-specific)

---

##  What's Been Installed

### Core Skills (4 Installed)

#### 1. Skill Creator (writing-skills)

**Source:** obra/superpowers
**Location:** `skills/skill-creator/`
**Description:** Create new skills, edit existing skills, verify skills work before deployment

**What It Does:**

- Guides you through creating custom skills via Socratic questioning
- Tests skills with subagents before writing
- Iterates until bulletproof against rationalization
- Applies TDD to process documentation

**When to Use:**

```
"Use Skill Creator to build a mobile UX validator"
"Help me create a skill that tracks customer acquisition metrics"
"Create a skill to enforce 2-hour session discipline"
```

---

#### 2. Systematic Debugging

**Source:** obra/superpowers
**Location:** `skills/systematic-debugging/`
**Description:** Four-phase debugging framework for bugs, test failures, unexpected behavior

**What It Does:**

- Phase 1: Root cause investigation (understand the problem)
- Phase 2: Pattern analysis (identify broader issues)
- Phase 3: Hypothesis testing (validate understanding)
- Phase 4: Implementation (fix with confidence)

**When to Use:**

```
"Use Systematic Debugging to investigate this Vercel error"
"Help me debug why tests are failing"
"This TypeScript error doesn't make sense - use systematic debugging"
```

**Time Saved:** Prevents rabbit holes in 2-hour sessions

---

#### 3. Brainstorming

**Source:** obra/superpowers
**Location:** `skills/brainstorming/`
**Description:** Transform rough ideas into fully-formed designs through structured Socratic questioning

**What It Does:**

- Refines rough ideas into complete designs
- Explores alternatives systematically
- Incremental validation of concepts
- Structured questioning before implementation

**When to Use:**

```
"Brainstorm: How to improve Audio Intel conversion from 60% to 75%"
"Help me brainstorm a new onboarding flow for totalaud.io"
"Brainstorm customer acquisition strategies for radio promoters"
```

---

#### 4. Changelog Generator

**Source:** ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills
**Location:** `skills/changelog-generator/`
**Description:** Automatically create user-facing changelogs from git commits

**What It Does:**

- Analyzes commit history
- Categorizes changes (features, fixes, improvements)
- Transforms technical commits into customer-friendly language
- Generates polished release notes

**When to Use:**

```
"Generate a changelog from commits since last release"
"Create customer-facing release notes for Audio Intel v1.2"
"Generate developer changelog for totalaud.io Phase 5"
```

**Time Saved:** Hours of manual changelog writing → minutes of automated generation

### This Week (3-4 Hours)

#### Day 1: Create Audio Intel Custom Skills

Use Skill Creator to build:

1. **audio-intel-mobile-validator**

   ```
   "Use Skill Creator to build a skill that validates mobile UX against 21 standards:

   Standards to check:
   1. Touch targets minimum 44x44px
   2. Responsive breakpoints (320px, 375px, 768px, 1024px)
   3. Loading states for all async operations
   4. Error boundaries and user-friendly error messages
   5. Form validation with inline feedback
   ... (continue with all 21 standards from CLAUDE.md)

   Trigger: When creating/modifying components in apps/audio-intel/"
   ```

2. **customer-acquisition-tracker**

   ```
   "Use Skill Creator to build a skill that tracks customer metrics:

   Metrics to track:
   - Current MRR: £0 → Target: £500
   - Demo calls booked vs completed
   - Conversion rates by segment (Radio 85%, Artist 60%, Agency 70%)
   - Beta signups from content marketing
   - Newsletter subscriber growth

   Trigger: When updating CLAUDE.md or customer data"
   ```

3. **two-hour-session-validator**

   ```
   "Use Skill Creator to build a skill that prevents scope creep:

   Checks at session start:
   - Task scope clearly defined
   - Success criteria measurable
   - Estimated time ≤ 2 hours
   - Customer acquisition focused

   Red flags:
   - 'Just one more optimization...'
   - 'Let me refactor this first...'
   - Perfectionism over shipping

   Trigger: Manual invocation at session start + every 30 mins"
   ```

---

#### Day 2: Create totalaud.io Custom Skills

4. **experimental-sandbox-guard**

   ```
   "Use Skill Creator to keep experiments separate from production:

   Checks when working in /totalaud.io:
   - No imports from /total-audio-platform
   - No shared Supabase tables affecting production
   - No production API keys in experimental code
   - Clear documentation of experiments"
   ```

5. **theme-system-validator**

   ```
   "Use Skill Creator for theme consistency:

   Validates across 5 themes (ascii, xp, aqua, daw, analogue):
   - All themes have required ThemeConfig keys
   - Colour contrast meets WCAG AA
   - Sound banks defined
   - Layout configs consistent

   Trigger: When modifying themes/ or theme-aware components"
   ```

---

#### Day 3: Test & Refine

- Test all 5 custom skills with real work
- Use Changelog Generator for recent commits
- Use Systematic Debugging on next bug
- Refine skills based on actual usage
- Measure time savings

---

## How Skills Support Your Goals

### Audio Intel (Customer Acquisition Phase)

**Goal:** First £500/month by November 2025

**Skills Supporting:**

- **customer-acquisition-tracker** → Track progress toward revenue goal
- **audio-intel-mobile-validator** → Quality doesn't slip during fast shipping
- **changelog-generator** → Build customer trust with transparent updates
- **two-hour-session-validator** → Maximize velocity in 2-hour sessions
- **systematic-debugging** → Fix blockers fast without rabbit holes

**Skills NOT Supporting (Deferred):**

-  Simplification Cascades → Refactoring won't get first customer
-  Code optimization skills → Defer until post-revenue

---

### totalaud.io (Experimental Sandbox)

**Goal:** Learn and innovate without affecting Audio Intel

**Skills Supporting:**

- **experimental-sandbox-guard** → Prevent experiments affecting production
- **theme-system-validator** → Maintain quality in experimental features
- **skill-creator** → Rapidly codify new patterns discovered
- **brainstorming** → Explore wild ideas systematically

---

## Integration with Existing Tools

### Git Workflow + Skills

```bash
# Before commit:
1. Skills validate code quality 
2. Changelog Generator creates notes 
3. Customer metrics updated 
4. Git commit with context 
```

```
Gmail MCP + Customer Tracker = Auto-track demo responses
Notion MCP + Changelog Generator = Auto-publish releases
Puppeteer MCP + Mobile Validator = Automated UX testing
```

### 2-Hour Sessions + Skills

```
Session Start:
1. Two-Hour Validator scopes work
2. Set clear completion criteria
3. Use Systematic Debugging if stuck

Every 30 mins:
1. Check time remaining
2. Adjust scope if needed
3. No rabbit holes

## Important Reminders

### Must Do Before Skills Work:

1. **Enable Skills in Claude Code:**
   - Open settings (⌘,)
   - Go to Capabilities
   - Toggle "Skills" ON
   - **Restart Claude Code** (critical!)

2. **Verify Skills Active:**
   - Open chat
   - Ask: "Are skills enabled?"
   - Claude should confirm and list installed skills

### How Skills Activate:

- **Automatic:** Skills auto-activate based on their description when relevant
- **Manual:** You can explicitly invoke: "Use [skill name] to..."
- **Context-Aware:** Skills use your codebase, Git history, CLAUDE.md instructions

### Token Usage:

- Skills consume tokens (they're additional context)
- Start with core 4 skills to establish baseline
- Add custom skills gradually
- Archive unused skills if token usage too high
- Monitor token costs weekly
