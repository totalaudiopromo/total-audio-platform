**Speaker Notes (30 seconds):**
"Bee, Adam, Dan, Sam - thank you for taking the time to meet today. I'm Chris, and as you know, I do radio promotion work remotely for Liberty. Over the past year, I've lived the daily pain of spending 15 hours researching BBC Radio contacts for every campaign. So I built Total Audio Promo - the tools I wished I had. Today, I want to show you how these tools can give your team back 387 hours per month, at pricing that independent agencies like Liberty can actually afford."

## SLIDE 2: THE LIBERTY STORY

**Headline:** From Kitchen Table to International Offices

**Subheadline:** Liberty Music PR's Mission-Driven Growth

**Content:**
- **2016:** Founded by Bee and Adam from Brighton flat (while pregnant)
- **2016-2020:** Grew to 40+ freelancers serving independent artists worldwide
- **2021-2024:** Expanded to London, LA offices
- **2025:** New York office in development
- **Recognition:** UK Top 10 Music PR Companies

**Data/Stat:** "From 2 founders to 40+ freelancers. From 1 city to 4 countries. All while empowering independent artists."

**Visual:**
- Animated timeline or world map showing expansion
- Brighton → London → LA → NY (coming soon)
- Photos of founders (if available) or Liberty office locations
- Purple gradient connecting locations

**Speaker Notes (1 minute):**
"Liberty Music PR started the same way Total Audio Promo did - solving a problem you experienced personally. Bee and Adam, you founded Liberty because you saw independent artists struggling to access professional PR services. You democratised music PR by making it accessible to emerging artists who couldn't afford major label rates.

In 9 years, you've grown from a kitchen table to offices in three countries, with a fourth on the way. You've built a team of 40+ freelancers, been recognised as one of the UK's Top 10 music PR agencies, and you've done it all while staying true to your mission: empowering artist independence.

That mission is exactly why Total Audio Promo exists. You democratised PR for artists. We're democratising enterprise-grade PR tools for agencies like you."

**Timing:** 1 minute

**Transition to next slide:**
"But as Liberty has scaled internationally, you've hit some workflow bottlenecks that spreadsheets and manual processes can't solve. Let me show you what I mean..."

## SLIDE 3: THE PROBLEM - CONTACT RESEARCH

**Headline:** 15 Hours Per Campaign Researching BBC Radio Contacts

**Subheadline:** Sam's Daily Reality

**Content:**
- **Hour 1-4:** Google searches for Jack Saunders, Clara Amfo, BBC Introducing presenters
- **Hour 5-8:** LinkedIn stalking producers, checking Twitter for submission preferences
- **Hour 9-12:** Calling industry contacts asking for intros and up-to-date emails
- **Hour 13-15:** Entering everything into spreadsheets (which are outdated by next campaign)

**Data/Stat:** "Sam's team spends 150 hours per month on contact research across 10 campaigns. That's £4,500 in labour costs before a single pitch is sent."

**Visual:**
- Split screen showing:
  - Left: Screenshot of messy Google Sheet with outdated contacts
  - Right: Clock showing 15 hours ticking away
- Or: Browser tabs mockup showing 20+ tabs open (Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, BBC website)
- Amber/red colour scheme emphasizing pain

**Speaker Notes (1 minute):**
"Sam, you know this pain intimately. When you get a new indie rock artist to pitch to BBC Radio, your workflow looks like this:

You spend hours Googling 'Jack Saunders BBC Radio 1 contact email' - again - even though you've done this before. You're on LinkedIn searching for producers. You're checking Twitter to see if Jack tweeted about how he prefers to receive music. You're texting industry contacts asking if they have an intro. And then you're entering all this into a spreadsheet that'll be outdated by your next campaign.

**Fifteen hours.** Before you've written a single word of a pitch. Before you've built a single relationship.

At Liberty's scale - 10 campaigns per month - that's 150 hours. At £30/hour, that's £4,500 per month your team spends on work a database should do in seconds."

**Timing:** 1 minute

**Transition to next slide:**
"And once you finally have the contacts, the next bottleneck hits..."

## SLIDE 4: THE PROBLEM - PITCH PERSONALISATION

**Headline:** Quality vs Speed: The Impossible Trade-Off

**Subheadline:** Every Publicist's Dilemma

**Content:**
- **Generic Pitch:** 15 minutes to write → Low response rate → Damages Liberty's reputation
- **Personalised Pitch:** 2-3 hours to write → High response rate → But no time for volume
- **The Dilemma:** Jack Saunders can tell when you've copy-pasted. But you have 15 more contacts to pitch today.

**Data/Stat:** "Sam's team spends 25 hours per month writing personalised pitches. Quality shouldn't require sacrificing speed."

**Visual:**
- Balance scale graphic tilting
  - Left side: "Quality Personalisation" (2-3 hours, heavy)
  - Right side: "Speed & Volume" (15 minutes, light)
- Centre: Question mark
- Or: Two pitch examples side-by-side (generic vs personalised) with response rates

**Speaker Notes (1 minute):**
"Here's Sam's daily dilemma: You know a personalised pitch to Jack Saunders works better. You know mentioning his recent support of similar artists gets his attention. You know referencing Future Sounds' Friday New Music slot shows you understand his show.

But that level of personalisation takes 2-3 hours per pitch. And you have 15 contacts to pitch today, plus three other campaigns running simultaneously.

So you make the trade-off: Write a slightly more generic pitch in 30 minutes, knowing it's less effective but at least you hit your volume targets. Or spend 3 hours crafting the perfect pitch, knowing your other campaigns are falling behind.

**This shouldn't be a choice.** Quality and speed shouldn't be mutually exclusive. But with current manual processes, they are."

**Timing:** 1 minute

**Transition to next slide:**
"And even if you solve contact research and pitch writing, there's a third challenge that's only getting worse as Liberty scales..."

## SLIDE 5: THE PROBLEM - CAMPAIGN CHAOS

**Headline:** Coordinating 40+ Freelancers Across 3 Countries

**Subheadline:** Spreadsheet Chaos at Scale

**Content:**
- **The Scenario:** Freelancer A contacts Jack Saunders Monday. Freelancer B doesn't see updated spreadsheet, contacts Jack again Wednesday. Jack is annoyed.
- **The Reality:** Shared Google Sheets across multiple time zones = version control nightmare
- **The Cost:** Duplicate outreach damages relationships. Missed follow-ups lose placements.

**Data/Stat:** "40+ freelancers. 3 time zones (Brighton, London, LA). 10+ campaigns running simultaneously. One outdated spreadsheet."

**Visual:**
- Chaotic graphic showing:
  - Multiple versions of same spreadsheet (Version 1, Version 2, Version 3...)
  - Tangled lines connecting freelancers across time zones
  - Error icons showing duplicate contacts
- Or: Screenshot of cluttered Slack channel with "Did anyone email Jack?" messages
- Red/amber colour scheme

**Speaker Notes (1 minute):**
"Dan, as you scale Liberty to LA and prepare for NY, this coordination challenge is only getting worse.

Here's what happens: Sarah in Brighton contacts Jack Saunders at BBC Radio 1 on Monday morning. She updates the shared Google Sheet. Tom in LA wakes up Tuesday, opens what he thinks is the latest spreadsheet - but it's yesterday's version. He contacts Jack Saunders on Wednesday. Jack receives the same pitch twice from the same agency. He's annoyed. Liberty's reputation takes a hit.

Multiply this across 40+ freelancers, 3 time zones, and 10 campaigns running simultaneously. You're spending hours in Slack asking 'Has anyone contacted Jack?' 'Who's handling Clara Amfo?' 'Which version of the spreadsheet is current?'

**Spreadsheets don't scale to international operations.** They worked when you were in one office. They're breaking now that you're in three countries."

**Timing:** 1 minute

**Transition to next slide:**
"Let me show you exactly what these three problems cost Liberty every month..."

## SLIDE 6: THE COST OF MANUAL WORKFLOW

**Headline:** £11,625 Wasted Every Month on Admin Work

**Subheadline:** The Hidden Cost of Manual Processes

**Content:**
- **Contact Research:** 150 hours/month × £30/hour = **£4,500/month**
- **Pitch Writing:** 25 hours/month × £30/hour = **£750/month**
- **Campaign Coordination:** 200 hours/month × £30/hour = **£6,000/month**
- **Client Reporting:** 40 hours/month × £30/hour = **£1,200/month**
- **TOTAL:** 415 hours/month = **£12,450/month** = **£149,400/year**

**Data/Stat:** "That's £149,400 per year your team spends on work that should take minutes. That's the equivalent of hiring 2.5 full-time senior publicists."

**Visual:**
- Stacked bar chart showing cost breakdown by category
- Large bold number: "£149,400/year" in red/amber
- Or: Pie chart with labour costs highlighted
- Include "= 2.5 FTE Publicists" annotation

**Speaker Notes (1.5 minutes):**
"Dan, this is where we get to the real cost of manual workflows. Let me break down what Liberty's team spends every month:

**£4,500 on contact research** - 150 hours across 10 campaigns, Googling information that should be in a database.

**£750 on pitch writing** - Not the strategic work, but the mechanical work of drafting and personalising from scratch every time.

**£6,000 on campaign coordination** - Version control chaos, Slack messages asking who's doing what, updating spreadsheets, preventing duplicate outreach.

**£1,200 on client reporting** - Manually compiling spreadsheet data into PDFs.

**Total: £12,450 per month. £149,400 per year.**

To put that in perspective: That's enough to hire 2.5 full-time senior publicists. Instead, that money is being spent on admin work that technology should handle in seconds.

And this is a conservative estimate. If your team's average rate is £40/hour instead of £30, we're talking about £199,200 per year."

**Timing:** 1.5 minutes

**Transition to next slide:**
"So here's what Total Audio Promo does: We give you back that time and that money. Let me show you how..."

**Audio Intel** solves contact research. You get 45 BBC Radio contacts - Jack Saunders, Clara Amfo, all BBC Introducing presenters across 40 regional stations - enriched with submission preferences, recent plays, show formats. In 30 seconds. Not 15 hours.

**Pitch Generator** solves the quality-vs-speed trade-off. Our AI uses Audio Intel's contact data to generate personalised pitches that reference Jack's recent shows, mention similar artists he's supported, and match his show format. You get an 80% complete personalised pitch in 30 seconds. Sam reviews and refines in 15 minutes. Quality and speed - no longer mutually exclusive.

And critically: **These tools work together.** Contacts from Audio Intel flow into Pitch Generator. Pitches flow into Campaign Tracker. Your team doesn't re-enter data three times."

**Speaker Notes (1 minute):**
"Here's what Audio Intel looks like. This is the actual interface Sam's team would use.

You open Audio Intel, click 'BBC Radio Contacts', and instantly you see 45 contacts enriched with everything you need:

**Jack Saunders** - BBC Radio 1 Future Sounds. His direct email (not the generic BBC inbox). Show format: Indie, alternative, new music discovery. Submission preferences: Streaming links preferred, no attachments. Recent artists: Here's who he's played in the last month, so you can reference them in your pitch.

You can filter by genre - show me just indie and alternative presenters. Export to CSV. Push directly to Campaign Tracker.

**From 15 hours of Google searches to 30 seconds of enriched intelligence.**

And because I do radio promo work for Liberty, I know these contacts are accurate. I verify them monthly. If you find an error, flag it - I update within 24 hours."

## SLIDE 9: PITCH GENERATOR - DEMO TEASER

**Headline:** Personalised Pitches in 15 Minutes, Not 2 Hours

**Subheadline:** AI-Powered, Human-Refined

**Content:**
- **Input:** Artist name, genre, key info, streaming link, target contact (Jack Saunders)
- **AI Analysis:** Understands Jack's show format, recent playlists, similar artists he's supported
- **Output:** Personalised pitch that sounds like a music publicist who knows Jack's show
- **Your Control:** Edit every word. Add personal touches. Maintain your voice and relationships.

**Data/Stat:** "Quality maintained, time reduced by 90%. From 2.5 hours → 15 minutes per campaign."

  - Generated pitch preview (with Jack Saunders example)
  - Edit interface
- Highlight personalisation elements: Custom greeting, show-specific references, similar artists mentioned
- Purple accent colours

**Speaker Notes (1.5 minutes):**
"Here's how Pitch Generator works. This solves the quality-vs-speed trade-off.

Sam enters the artist details: 'The Wilderness, indie rock, debut single 'Northern Lights', UK tour October-November, BBC Introducing featured.' Selects target contact: Jack Saunders, BBC Radio 1 Future Sounds.

The AI takes 30 seconds to generate a pitch. Watch what it does:

**'Hi Jack, hope Future Sounds is going well. I wanted to share The Wilderness with you - an indie rock band whose debut single 'Northern Lights' would fit perfectly on your Friday New Music slot. They've got that same atmospheric energy as [recent artist Jack played], with Foals-level production. BBC Introducing featured them last month, and they're touring the UK in October. I think your listeners who loved [another artist] will dig this. Streaming link here...'**

Notice: Personal greeting to Jack. References Future Sounds specifically. Mentions the Friday New Music slot (showing Sam knows his show). Compares to artists Jack recently supported. References BBC Introducing (credibility).

**This isn't a template. The AI understands Jack's show.**

And critically: Sam reviews this, edits it, adds his own personal touches. The AI gives him an 80% complete pitch in 30 seconds. Sam refines to 100% in 15 minutes. **Quality maintained, time reduced by 90%.**"

**Timing:** 1.5 minutes

**Transition to next slide:**
"With contacts enriched and pitches ready, the final challenge is coordination. That's what Campaign Tracker solves..."

## SLIDE 11: THE ROI - TIME SAVINGS

**Headline:** Get 38.75 Hours Back Per Campaign

**Subheadline:** 93.3% Reduction in Admin Time

**Content:**
- **Before Total Audio Promo:** 41.5 hours per campaign (contact research, pitch writing, coordination, reporting)
- **After Total Audio Promo:** 2.75 hours per campaign (quick reviews and refinements)
- **Time Saved:** 38.75 hours per campaign
- **At Liberty's Scale:** 10 campaigns/month = 387.5 hours saved per month = 4,590 hours/year

**Data/Stat:** "That's like adding 2.2 full-time employees worth of capacity. Without hiring anyone."

**Visual:**
- Dramatic before/after bar chart
  - Before: Massive 41.5-hour bar (red)
  - After: Tiny 2.75-hour bar (green)
  - Time saved: 38.75 hours highlighted (cyan)
- Or: Clock graphic showing time reclaimed
- Make the visual impact visceral

**Speaker Notes (1.5 minutes):**
"Let me show you exactly what this means for Liberty's team.

**Current workflow:** 41.5 hours per campaign spent on admin work. Contact research (15h), pitch writing (2.5h), coordination (20h), reporting (4h).

**With Total Audio Promo:** 2.75 hours per campaign. Quick contact verification (30 min), pitch review and refinement (15 min), campaign updates (2h), report final review (30 min).

**Time saved per campaign: 38.75 hours.** That's a 93.3% reduction in admin time.

At Liberty's scale - 10 campaigns per month - that's **387.5 hours saved every month**. Per year, that's 4,590 hours.

To put that in perspective: That's equivalent to adding 2.2 full-time senior publicists to your team. Except you didn't hire anyone. You just eliminated the admin work that was burying your existing team.

**Where does that time go?** Sam's team spends it building relationships with Jack Saunders and Clara Amfo. Having coffee with BBC producers. Strategising on how to position artists. The high-value work that actually secures placements - not Googling email addresses."

## SLIDE 12: THE ROI - FINANCIAL CASE

**Headline:** £125,700 Net Benefit Per Year

**Subheadline:** 1,048% ROI with 1.3 Month Payback

**Content:**
- **Time Saved (Annual):** 4,590 hours/year
- **Value of Time Saved:** £137,700/year (at £30/hour freelancer rate)
- **Total Audio Promo Cost:** £12,000/year (mid-tier, 10 campaigns/month)
- **Net Annual Benefit:** £125,700/year
- **ROI:** 1,048%
- **Payback Period:** 1.3 months (6 weeks)

**Data/Stat:** "Even if we only deliver 50% of estimated savings, that's still 474% ROI. This is a highly risk-mitigated investment."

**Visual:**
- ROI calculation flow:
  - Time saved (4,590h) × Rate (£30/h) = Value (£137,700)
  - Minus Cost (£12,000) = Net Benefit (£125,700)
  - ROI: 1,048%
- Large bold numbers for Net Benefit and ROI
- Green highlighting on positive numbers
- Optional: Payback timeline graphic showing breakeven at Week 6

**Speaker Notes (2 minutes):**
"Dan, here's the financial case for Total Audio Promo.

**Annual time savings:** 4,590 hours. At your current freelancer rate of £30/hour, that's **£137,700 worth of time** your team gets back every year.

**Total Audio Promo cost:** £12,000 per year for mid-tier agency pricing (10 campaigns/month). That's £1,000 per month.

**Net benefit after costs: £125,700 per year.**

**ROI: 1,048%.** For every £1 you invest in Total Audio Promo, you get back £10.48 in labour savings.

**Payback period: 1.3 months.** By Week 6, the tool has paid for itself. The remaining 10.5 months of the year is pure benefit.

Now, I know you're thinking: 'Those savings sound too good to be true.' So let me show you the conservative scenario.

**If we only deliver 50% of the estimated savings** - maybe the learning curve is steeper, maybe not every campaign sees full time savings - you still save 2,295 hours per year, worth £68,850. Minus our £12,000 cost = £56,850 net benefit. **That's still 474% ROI.**

Even in the worst-case scenario, this is a highly attractive investment. And based on my own experience using these tools, the time savings are real."

## SLIDE 13: COMPETITIVE COMPARISON

**Headline:** UK Pricing for UK Agencies

**Subheadline:** Music-Specific vs Generic Enterprise Tools

**Content:**

| Tool | Annual Cost | Music-Specific | BBC Radio | Liberty Fit |
|------|-------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Muck Rack** | £11,700-£39,000 | ❌ Generic PR | ❌ Limited | Too expensive |
| **Cision** | £20,000-£46,800 | ❌ Corporate PR | ❌ Limited | Wrong focus |
| **Propel** | £2,000-£5,000 | ❌ Generic PR | ❌ None | No BBC specialisation |
| **Total Audio Promo** | **£12,000** | ✅ Music-only | ✅ 45+ contacts | **Perfect fit** |

**Speaker Notes (2 minutes):**
"Before you say yes, you're probably wondering: 'What about the industry leaders? Muck Rack and Cision have been around for years. Shouldn't we use them?'

Let me show you why they're not the right fit for Liberty.

**Muck Rack** costs £11,700 to £39,000 per year for an agency your size. It's brilliant enterprise software - for Fortune 500 companies doing corporate PR. They have 5 million journalists in their database. But here's the problem: **It's not built for music PR.**

Their database is US-centric. Generic journalists, not music-specific. They might have 'BBC contacts', but they don't track that Jack Saunders moved from Radio 1Xtra to Future Sounds. They don't know his submission preferences. They don't understand the difference between pitching BBC Radio 1 and 6 Music.

**You'd still spend 15 hours researching BBC Radio contacts** because Muck Rack doesn't have the music-specific intelligence you need.

**Cision** costs £20,000 to £46,800 per year. It's even more enterprise-focused. Press release distribution over newswires. Great for corporate earnings announcements. But when was the last time an independent artist issued a press release over PR Newswire? **That's not your workflow.**

**Propel** is affordable at £2,000-£5,000 per year, and it's well-designed. But it's generic PR. No BBC Radio specialisation. No music industry intelligence. You'd save money upfront but still spend 15 hours on contact research.

**Total Audio Promo** costs £12,000 per year - mid-market pricing. But we're **music-specific**. BBC Radio contacts curated and maintained. Built by someone who does radio promo for Liberty. This isn't an enterprise tool we're force-fitting - this is a tool built from your actual workflow."

## SLIDE 14: WHY UK-BUILT MATTERS

**Headline:** BBC Radio Contacts, UK Platforms, UK Pricing

**Subheadline:** Built for the UK Music Industry

**Content:**
- **BBC Radio is Critical:** R1, 6 Music, Introducing (40+ regional stations), 1Xtra, Asian Network - this is how UK artists break through
- **UK Music Industry Structure:** Different from US (no Clear Channel equivalent), relationship-driven, community radio matters
- **UK Pricing Philosophy:** Not Silicon Valley SaaS pricing (£10k-50k/year), priced for independent agencies (£500-2k/month)
- **Built by Practitioners:** Chris does radio promo for Liberty - this is the tool he needed himself

**Data/Stat:** "The UK music industry contributed £7.6bn to the UK economy in 2023. It deserves UK-built tools that understand how it actually works."

**Visual:**
- UK flag or map outline (subtle, not cheesy)
- BBC Radio logos (R1, 6 Music, Introducing)

- Or: List of 40 BBC regional stations
- Purple/cyan colour scheme

**Speaker Notes (1.5 minutes):**
"Bee, Adam - this is where Total Audio Promo aligns with Liberty's mission.

You founded Liberty to **democratise music PR** for independent artists. You saw major labels hoarding resources and expertise, and you said 'independent artists deserve professional PR too.'

Total Audio Promo is built on the same principle: **Democratising enterprise-grade PR tools** for independent agencies.

Muck Rack and Cision charge £10,000-£50,000 per year because they're pricing for Fortune 500 companies. We're pricing for agencies like Liberty - £500-£2,000 per month depending on scale. **UK pricing, not Silicon Valley pricing.**

And we understand the UK music industry. BBC Radio is how UK artists break through. Jack Saunders, Clara Amfo, BBC Introducing across 40 regional stations - these relationships matter. US tools don't prioritise this. **We do - because Chris does radio promo in the UK music industry.**

The UK music industry contributed £7.6 billion to the UK economy in 2023. It employs 216,000 people. It deserves tools built specifically for how it works - not enterprise software retrofitted from corporate PR."

- **Success Metric:** Save minimum 10 hours per campaign (we're claiming 17+, so 10 is conservative threshold)
- **Risk Mitigation:** Money-back guarantee if you hate it after Week 2. No long-term commitment. Full data export anytime.

**Data/Stat:** "£500 to test £11,625/month of claimed value. If it doesn't work, you've spent less than 2 days of your current time waste."

**Visual:**
- Clean infographic showing pilot structure
- 4-week timeline (horizontal)
- Key metrics highlighted: £500, 4 weeks, 2 campaigns, 10+ hours saved
- Green "Zero Risk" badge or icon
- Confidence-building visual (handshake, shield, checkmark)

**Speaker Notes (1.5 minutes):**
"I know what you're thinking: 'This sounds great, but what if it doesn't work for our workflow? What if our team doesn't use it? What if the time savings don't materialise?'

That's exactly why I'm **not** asking you to commit to an annual contract today. Here's what I'm proposing:

**A 4-week pilot program.**

Sam and two team members of his choice test Total Audio Promo on 2 real campaigns. Not artificial tests - your actual workflow with real artists pitching real BBC Radio contacts.

**Investment: £500.** That's 75% off our standard £2,000/month pricing. We're betting on ourselves that once you see the time savings, you'll want to continue.

**Success metric:** If we don't save Sam's team at least 10 hours per campaign, we haven't delivered value. I'm claiming 17+ hours saved per campaign, so 10 hours is a conservative threshold.

**Risk mitigation:**
- If you hate it after Week 2, money-back guarantee - full £500 refunded
- No long-term commitment - pilot ends after 4 weeks, you decide whether to continue
- Your data stays yours - full export anytime, we delete your account data if you cancel

**What are you risking?** £500 and 4 weeks of Sam's time. What are you potentially gaining? £125,700 per year in net benefit. **That's an asymmetric bet in your favour.**"

**Speaker Notes (1.5 minutes):**
"Here's exactly what the 4-week pilot looks like:

**Week 1 - Setup:** We create accounts for Sam and 2 team members. Sam selects the first campaign - ideally an active radio campaign with BBC focus. Day 3, I do a 60-minute hands-on training session. No 6-week certification course - just 60 minutes and you're up and running. Sam's team starts using the tools by end of Week 1.

**Week 2 - Active Execution:** Campaign 1 is in full swing. Sam's team tracks time spent - how long on contact research (should be seconds with Audio Intel), how long on pitch creation (should be 15 minutes with Pitch Generator), how coordinated do they feel (Campaign Tracker shows everyone's work). I'm available for support, response within 24 hours. Quick 15-minute check-in Monday to address any issues.

**Week 3 - Independence:** Campaign 2 launches. Sam's team is working more independently now. I'm still available, but they shouldn't need hand-holding anymore. We collect feedback: What's working? What needs improvement? 30-minute check-in to refine anything needed.

**Week 4 - Results:** We compile all the time tracking data. Calculate actual time savings: Did we deliver the claimed 17+ hours saved per campaign? Team satisfaction survey: Would you want to keep using this? Results presentation: I show you the data, Sam's team shares their experience, you decide whether to continue.

**No pressure. No tricks. Just data.**"
