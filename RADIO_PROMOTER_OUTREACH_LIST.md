Subject: Simon - built something that saves me 15+ hours per campaign

Hi Simon,

Chris here - we used to work together at [context]. Hope you're doing well.

Since then I've been doing radio promotion (5+ years now, pitched to BBC Radio 6 Music,
Amazing Radio, loads of regional stations) and producing as sadact.

Quick one: I was spending 15+ hours per campaign researching, verifying, and organizing
station contacts. Built a tool that cut it to 3 minutes.

Thought you might find it useful given the volume you're probably handling at Shy Cat.

Made a 3-minute Loom showing how it works with real contacts: [Loom link]

If it's useful, you can try 10 enrichments free (no demo call needed): [link]

Would be great to catch up regardless. How's Shy Cat going?
