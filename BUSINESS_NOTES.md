## 📅 SEPTEMBER 2025

### Week of Sept 30th - Major Consolidation Session

**Technical Completed:**
- ✅ Liberty training data processed: 39,883 messages, 4,560 campaign patterns
- ✅ MCP infrastructure cleanup: Removed broken Calendar/Chat MCPs
- ✅ Confirmed working MCPs: Gmail, Drive, Notion, Puppeteer, GitHub, YouTube

**Content Strategy Fixed:**
- ✅ Removed all false BBC Radio 1 placement claims (no actual Radio 1 plays)
- ✅ Removed weak metrics (33 plays across low-quality stations not marketing material)
- ✅ Reframed to process benefits: time savings (15hrs→3min), accuracy (60%→94%), response rates (8%→35%)
- ✅ 43 content pieces updated with authentic positioning

**Key Decisions:**
1. Stop debugging infrastructure - use what works, focus on customer acquisition
2. Only use defensible claims - 5+ years experience, BBC Radio 6 Music pitches, real time savings
3. Lead with process benefits, not vanity metrics
4. Authentic positioning: Brighton producer (sadact), uses tool daily

- Liberty training data accessible for agent context
