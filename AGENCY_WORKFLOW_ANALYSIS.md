---

## Phase 2: Contact Research (Weeks 1-2) 🔴 CRITICAL PAIN POINT

### Current Manual Process

**Radio Contact Research (8-10 hours per campaign):**

1. **Identify Target Shows** (2 hours)
   - Research BBC Radio schedule
   - Identify relevant shows (genre, artist level)
   - Jack Saunders (Future Sounds), Clara Amfo, Sian Eleri (Future Artists)
   - Regional BBC stations (BBC Introducing)
   - Specialist shows (6 Music, 1Xtra, etc.)

2. **Find Contact Details** (4-6 hours)
   - Google searches: "[Presenter name] BBC Radio contact email"
   - Check BBC website (often outdated)
   - LinkedIn searches for producers
   - Twitter/Instagram DM attempts
   - Ask industry contacts for introductions

3. **Research Submission Preferences** (2 hours)
   - How does each presenter prefer to receive music?

   - What format? MP3? WAV? Streaming link?
   - What information do they want in the pitch?

4. **Build Contact Database** (1-2 hours)
   - Enter into spreadsheet

1. **Identify Target Playlists** (1 hour)

2. **Find Curator Contacts** (2-3 hours)

   - Check playlist descriptions for submission info

3. **Research Curator Preferences** (1 hour)
   - What music does this playlist feature?
   - Submission process? SubmitHub? Email? Form?

**Press Contact Research (2-3 hours per campaign):**

1. **Identify Target Publications** (30 min)
   - Music blogs and websites
   - Online magazines
   - Genre-specific outlets

2. **Find Journalist/Editor Details** (1-2 hours)
   - Who covers this genre?
   - Current contact email (often outdated on websites)
   - Preferred pitch topics and angles

3. **Update Contact Database** (30 min)
   - Verify emails still valid
   - Update job titles (journalists move frequently)

**TOTAL CONTACT RESEARCH TIME: 15+ hours per campaign**

---

### Total Audio Promo Solution: Audio Intel

**Time Investment with Audio Intel: 30 seconds**

**Process:**
1. Open Audio Intel
2. Select "BBC Radio Contacts" (45+ contacts instantly)

**Time Savings: 15 hours → 30 seconds (99.94% reduction)**

**Value at £30/hour freelancer rate: £450 saved per campaign**

---

### Why This is Liberty's #1 Pain Point

**Sam Jones (Head of Press & Radio) Perspective:**

"I have a new artist in the indie rock space. I need to pitch Jack Saunders at BBC Radio 1, Sian Eleri for Future Artists, and the relevant 6 Music shows. Right now I spend:

- 2 hours researching who the current producers are
- 1 hour finding up-to-date contact emails
- 1 hour researching their submission preferences
- 30 minutes entering into spreadsheet

That's 4.5 hours before I've even started writing the pitch. And I'll do this 3-4 times per week.

**With Audio Intel, this would take 30 seconds.**"

---

## Phase 3: Pitch Creation (Week 2) 🔴 CRITICAL PAIN POINT

### Current Manual Process

**Writing Personalised Pitches (2-3 hours per campaign):**

1. **Research Each Contact** (30-60 minutes)
   - Review presenter's recent shows
   - Check Twitter for music they've played
   - Understand their taste and show format
   - Note recent guests or features

2. **Draft Core Pitch** (30 minutes)
   - Artist introduction
   - Music description
   - Why this matters (story, context)
   - Streaming links and assets

3. **Personalise for Each Contact** (60-90 minutes)
   - Custom intro referencing presenter's show
   - Explain why this artist fits their format
   - Mention recent artists they've supported
   - Adjust tone for each outlet (BBC R1 vs 6 Music very different)

4. **Proofread and Refine** (15-30 minutes)
   - Check for typos (critical - bad pitch hurts reputation)
   - Ensure all links work
   - Verify correct name spelling (embarrassing mistakes damage relationships)

**TOTAL PITCH CREATION TIME: 2-3 hours per campaign**

**Multiplier Effect:**
- Liberty runs 10 campaigns/month
- Each campaign = 2.5 hours average pitch creation
- Total: **25 hours/month spent writing pitches**

---

### Total Audio Promo Solution: Pitch Generator

**Time Investment with Pitch Generator: 15 minutes**

**Process:**
1. Open Pitch Generator
2. Input artist details (name, genre, music links)
3. Input target contact (Jack Saunders, BBC Radio 1)
4. AI generates personalised pitch in 30 seconds
5. Review and edit (10-15 minutes to refine and add personal touches)
6. **Done.**

**Time Savings: 2.5 hours → 15 minutes (90% reduction)**

**Value at £30/hour freelancer rate: £67.50 saved per campaign**

**Critical Note:** AI provides first draft, publicist refines. Maintains quality and personal touch while eliminating blank-page syndrome.

---

### Why This is Liberty's #2 Pain Point

**Sam Jones Perspective:**

"I've been pitching to Jack Saunders for years. I know what he likes, I know his show format. But every single time, I start with a blank page and spend 2 hours crafting the perfect pitch.

The AI doesn't need to write a perfect pitch - it needs to give me an 80% complete draft that I can refine in 15 minutes. That's the time savings I need.

And for new team members? They don't know Jack's show history. The AI can help them sound professional from day one."

---

## Phase 4: Outreach & Relationship Building (Weeks 3-6)

### Current Workflow

**Email Outreach (Ongoing):**

1. **Send Initial Pitches** (1-2 hours)
   - Personalised emails to target list
   - Track who's been contacted in spreadsheet
   - Note send dates

2. **Follow-up Emails** (2-3 hours per week)
   - 1-2 week follow-up to non-responders
   - "Just checking if you had a chance to listen..."
   - Track follow-up dates

3. **Phone Calls** (3-5 hours per week)
   - Relationship building with key contacts
   - Follow-up on pitches
   - Casual check-ins

4. **Response Management** (Ongoing)
   - Reply to questions
   - Send additional assets
   - Coordinate interviews/features

**TOTAL TIME: 6-10 hours per week per campaign**

**This is relationship work - NOT AUTOMATABLE**

**Total Audio Promo Impact:** ⚠️ Minimal - but more time saved from research/pitching = more time for relationships

---

## Phase 5: Campaign Coordination (Weeks 3-8) 🟡 MODERATE PAIN POINT

### Current Manual Process

**Tracking Campaign Progress (Ongoing):**

1. **Update Campaign Spreadsheet** (30 min per day)
   - Who's been contacted?
   - Who responded?
   - Who's playing the track?
   - What's the status of each pitch?

2. **Team Coordination** (1-2 hours per week)
   - Multiple team members working on same campaign
   - Version control nightmare (5 different spreadsheets with conflicting data)
   - Who's responsible for following up with which contact?
   - Slack/email coordination to avoid duplicate outreach

3. **Client Updates** (1 hour per week)
   - Email client with progress
   - "BBC Radio 1 passed, but 6 Music interested"
   - Manage expectations

**Pain Points:**
- No single source of truth (multiple spreadsheets)
- Version control chaos (who has the latest version?)
- Difficult to get overview of all campaigns at once

**TOTAL TIME: ~5 hours per week per campaign**

**Liberty Scale Impact:**

   - Review spreadsheet for all placements

## Workflow Bottlenecks & Friction Points

### Bottleneck #1: Contact Research Creates Campaign Delays

**Problem:**
- Campaign planning complete (Week 1)
- Contact research takes Week 1-2
- Can't start pitching until contacts found
- 1-2 week delay before campaign really begins

**Impact:**
- Release timing critical (artists have specific release dates)
- 2-week delay = less runway for placements
- Pressure on Sam's team to rush research (leads to errors)

**Solution with Audio Intel:**
- Contact research in 30 seconds (Week 1)
- Pitching begins immediately
- Full 8-12 week campaign runway maintained

---

### Bottleneck #2: Pitch Quality vs Speed Trade-off

**Problem:**
- High-quality personalised pitches take 2-3 hours
- Liberty's reputation depends on pitch quality
- Volume pressure (10 campaigns) forces speed
- Speed sacrifices quality → fewer placements

**Sam's Dilemma:**
"Do I spend 3 hours writing the perfect pitch for Jack Saunders, or 30 minutes writing a generic pitch so I can move to the next campaign? I know the perfect pitch works better, but I don't have time."

**Solution with Pitch Generator:**
- AI provides 80% complete personalised pitch in 30 seconds
- Sam refines in 15 minutes
- Quality maintained, speed achieved
- Best of both worlds

---

### Bottleneck #3: Campaign Coordination Across 40+ Freelancers

**Problem:**
- Freelancer A contacts Jack Saunders (Monday)
- Freelancer B doesn't know, contacts Jack Saunders again (Wednesday)
- Jack receives duplicate pitch, annoyed
- Liberty's reputation damaged

**Current Solution:**
- Shared Google Sheet
- "Check the sheet before contacting anyone"
- **Problem:** Sheet isn't updated in real-time, still get duplicates

**Solution with Campaign Tracker:**
- Real-time visibility of who's been contacted
- Prevents duplicate outreach
- 40+ freelancers see same live data

---

### Bottleneck #4: Client Reporting Delays Campaign Wrap-up

**Problem:**
- Campaign ends Week 8-12
- Client report takes 3-5 hours to compile
- Publicist delays report because it's tedious
- Client waits 2-3 weeks for report
- Client satisfaction drops

**Solution with Campaign Tracker:**
- One-click export generates 80% complete report
- Publicist adds notes in 30 minutes
- Client receives report same week campaign ends
- Client satisfaction increases

## Comparison to Other Industries

### Why Music PR is Uniquely Time-Intensive

**Music PR vs Corporate PR:**

| Factor | Corporate PR | Music PR | Impact |
|--------|--------------|----------|--------|
| **Campaign Duration** | 1-2 weeks (press release) | 8-12 weeks (release cycle) | Music requires sustained effort |
| **Contact Research** | Generic journalist database | Niche BBC presenters, curators | Music requires specialist contacts |
| **Pitch Personalisation** | Template press release | Custom pitch per contact | Music requires high personalisation |
| **Relationship Dependency** | Low (newswire distribution) | High (personal relationships) | Music requires relationship time |

**Why Muck Rack/Cision Don't Fit:**
- Built for corporate PR workflow (press releases)
- Generic journalist database (millions of contacts, but missing BBC Radio music producers)
- Template-based pitches (doesn't work for music industry relationships)
- Expensive (£10,000+/year assumes corporate budget)

**Why Total Audio Promo Fits:**
- Built for music PR workflow (radio campaigns, playlists)
- Specialist contact database (curated BBC Radio, music industry)
- AI trained on music pitches (sounds like music publicist, not corporate PR)
- Affordable (independent agency pricing)
