## 1. CAMPAIGN TRACKER - ISSUES FOUND

### What I Tested

**Route Check**:

-  `/dashboard/liberty` route does NOT exist
- `/dashboard` route exists (shows all user campaigns)

**Campaign Detail Page Structure**:

- Campaign detail page exists at `/campaigns/[id]`
-  **ISSUE**: Does NOT have 4 tabs (Overview, Contacts, Timeline, Reports)
- **ACTUAL**: Shows single-page layout with:
  - Stats cards (Target Reach, Actual Reach, Success Rate, Budget)
  - Contact List component
  - Timeline section
  - Notes section

**WARM Report Upload**:

-  **NOT FOUND**: No WARM report upload functionality in codebase
- CSV import exists for campaigns (not WARM reports)

### Issues Found

#### Issue 1: Demo Script Route Mismatch (BLOCKING)

**Script Says**: "Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard/liberty"  
**Reality**: Route doesn't exist. Should be `/dashboard`  
**Impact**: **DEMO-BLOCKING** - Demo will fail at first step  
**Fix**: Update demo script to use `/dashboard` OR create `/dashboard/liberty` route

#### Issue 2: Campaign Detail Tabs Don't Match (BLOCKING)

**Script Says**: "4 tabs (Overview, Contacts, Timeline, Reports)"  
**Reality**: Single-page layout with sections (Stats, Contact List, Timeline, Notes)  
**Impact**: **DEMO-BLOCKING** - Script describes UI that doesn't exist  
**Fix**: Update demo script to match actual UI OR add tabs (not recommended - too much work)

#### Issue 3: WARM Report Upload Missing (BLOCKING)

**Script Says**: "WARM report upload works"  
**Reality**: No WARM upload functionality found  
**Impact**: **DEMO-BLOCKING** - Can't demo this feature  
**Fix**: Remove from demo script OR build feature (not recommended - too much work)

### What Actually Works 

- Dashboard shows campaigns
- Campaign cards display metrics
- Campaign detail page shows stats, contacts, timeline
- CSV import for campaigns works
- AI Campaign Autopsy exists (mentioned in script)
- Intelligence bar shows patterns

### Recommended Demo Flow (Adjusted)

**Instead of**:

1. Navigate to `/dashboard/liberty` 
2. Show 4 tabs 
3. Upload WARM report 

**Do This**:

1. Navigate to `/dashboard` 
2. Show campaign cards with metrics 
3. Click into campaign → Show single-page detail view 
4. Highlight: Stats, Contact List, Timeline sections 
5. Show CSV import for campaigns 
6. Demo AI Campaign Autopsy 

**Timing**: ~2.5 minutes (matches script timing)

## 2. AUDIO INTEL - READY

### What I Tested

**Demo Flow**:

- Homepage demo exists (`/demo` route)
- Contact enrichment works via CSV upload
- Results display properly
- Export functionality exists (CSV, Excel, PDF)
- Case studies page exists with sadact example

**sadact/"Maybe (i)" Demo Data**:

- sadact case study exists in case studies page
- Can use existing case study OR create demo CSV on-the-fly
- No pre-loaded "Maybe (i)" specific data (not needed - use case study)

### What Works 

- Search/enrich functionality works
- Results display as expected
- Export/save functionality works
- Demo data (sadact) available via case study

### Demo Flow Verification 

**Recommended Flow**:

1. Navigate to homepage → Show live demo enrichment (30s)
2. Navigate to `/case-studies` → Show sadact BBC Radio 1 case study (2 min)
3. Show export options (30s)

**Total Time**: ~3 minutes (matches script)

## 3. PITCH GENERATOR - READY

### What I Tested

**Generation Flow**:

- Input fields work (contact, artist, track, genre, key hook)
- Generation produces output (GPT-4 integration)
- Timing: ~3-5 seconds actual generation + UI = ~10-15 seconds total
- Script says "30 seconds" (conservative - good for demo)

**sadact/"Maybe (i)" Demo Data**:

- Can add contact manually during demo (30s)
- Can enter "sadact" as artist, "Maybe (i)" as track
- Works with any artist/track combination

### What Works 

- Input fields work
- Generation produces reasonable output
- Timing is realistic (faster than script estimate)
- Copy to clipboard works
- Multiple pitch generation works

### Demo Flow Verification 

**Recommended Flow**:

1. Navigate to `/pitch/generate`
2. Add contact (or select existing): "Jack Saunders, BBC Radio 1" (30s)
3. Enter: Artist "sadact", Track "Maybe (i)", Genre "Electronic", Key Hook (50+ chars) (30s)
4. Click Generate → Show result (15s)
5. Generate 2 more pitches for different contacts (60s)

**Total Time**: ~2-3 minutes (matches script)

## 4. DEMO DATA (sadact/"Maybe (i)") - WORKS

### Status by Tool

| Tool                 | sadact Data             | "Maybe (i)" Data              | Status                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Audio Intel**      | Case study exists    | Can reference in demo      | Works                      |
| **Pitch Generator**  | Can enter manually   | Can enter manually         | Works                      |
| **Campaign Tracker** | Seed script includes | Not specifically mentioned | Works (use seed campaigns) |

### Verification 

- Audio Intel: sadact case study ready to show
- Pitch Generator: Can enter sadact/"Maybe (i)" during demo
- Campaign Tracker: sadact campaigns in seed script (can use)

**No blocking issues** - All tools can handle demo data

## FIXES REQUIRED BEFORE THURSDAY 19TH

### Priority 1: Update Campaign Tracker Demo Script (CRITICAL)
