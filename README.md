   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. Start development servers:
   ```bash
   # Start all apps
   npm run dev
   
   # Or start individual apps:
   npm run dev:audio-intel      # Audio Intel platform
   npm run dev:web             # Main landing page
   npm run dev:playlist-pulse  # Playlist Pulse platform
   npm run dev:command-centre  # Command Centre dashboard
   npm run dev:backend         # API backend
   ```

##  Deployment

### Vercel Deployment Commands
```bash
# Deploy individual apps to production
cd apps/audio-intel && vercel --prod
cd apps/web && vercel --prod  
cd apps/playlist-pulse && vercel --prod
