- Geographic distribution within UK

- Conversion timeline patterns

- Churn analysis by tier

1. **Audio Intel Usage Patterns**

- What types of contacts do paying users enrich?

- Usage frequency patterns (daily vs weekly users)

- Feature utilization (which features predict upgrade?)

- Session duration and return behavior

1. **Customer Journey Mapping**

- How do users discover Audio Intel?

- What triggers the upgrade decision?

- Which onboarding steps correlate with retention?

**Research Questions:**

Demographics:

- Music genre focus
- Career stage (bedroom producer, gigging artist, small label?)

Behavior Patterns:
- How many contacts do they enrich before upgrading?

Pain Points:
- What problem were they trying to solve before Audio Intel?

```

### **Layer 2: Direct Customer Interviews (Qualitative)**

**Target Interview Segments:**

** Segment A: Pro Tier Subscribers (£19/month)**_Sample Size: 10-15 interviews_

- "How much time did you spend researching each contact?"
- "What was your monthly spend on promotion tools before Audio Intel?"
- "What made you start looking for a solution like ours?"

Audio Intel Experience:
- "What specific moment convinced you to upgrade from free?"
- "Which feature saves you the most time?"
- "How has Audio Intel changed your promotion workflow?"
- "What would make you cancel your subscription?"

Value Perception:
- "How do you measure success with Audio Intel?"
- "What would you pay for this if we charged differently?"

```

** Segment B: Agency Tier Prospects (£79/month)**_Sample Size: 5-8 interviews_

```plain text
Business Context:
- "How many artists/clients do you manage?"

Alternative Solutions:

```

** Segment D: Churned Users (Left Platform)**_Sample Size: 5-8 interviews_

```plain text

```
