## TWITTER THREADS (Authentic Voice)

### Thread 1: Why 94% of music marketing tasks can be automated

Right, so this whole music marketing automation thing...

94% of what we do is basically admin work that could be sorted automatically

1/ Contact list building - currently eating 15+ hours a week of my life

Manual research is killing any chance of actually making music tbh

Use AI contact discovery tools

Set automated database updates

Import from verified industry sources

Stop building lists. Start building relationships mate

2/ Email personalisation takes ages for scale tho

Generic pitches get about 2% response rates (brutal)

Use AI to customise subject lines

Automate personal detail insertion

Create template variations by genre

Personalisation at scale beats mass generic outreach

3/ Social media posting eats daily creative time

Inconsistent posting kills algorithmic reach

Schedule content across all platforms

Auto-resize posts for each network

Set up cross-platform syndication

Consistency builds audiences. Automation enables consistency

4/ Campaign tracking requires manual data entry

Spreadsheet updates waste 5+ hours weekly (properly annoying)

Connect analytics APIs automatically

Set up real-time dashboard updates

Create automated performance reports

Data collection should inform decisions, not consume time

5/ Release timeline coordination overwhelms small teams

Missing deadlines kills campaign momentum

Use automated milestone reminders

Set up stakeholder notification systems

Create task dependency workflows

Perfect timing separates successful releases from forgotten ones

6/ Industry relationship management gets lost in chaos

Important contacts fall through manual cracks

Automate follow-up sequences

Set reminder systems for key dates

Track interaction history automatically

Relationships drive careers. Systems preserve relationships

Why 94% of music marketing tasks can be automated:

- Contact discovery

- Email personalisation

- Social media management

- Analytics tracking

- Timeline coordination

- Relationship management

Focus on music. Let technology handle the rest mate

## ACTION TWEETS (Authentic Voice)

**Tweet 1:** Radio submission windows close faster than you think

Most stations plan 6-8 weeks ahead for new music

Submit 2 months before target airplay date

Research their typical lead times first

Include multiple format options (clean/explicit)

Early submission beats perfect timing every time

**Tweet 2:** Playlist curator burnout is real and growing tbh

Standing out requires genuine personalisation

Reference their last 3 playlist additions specifically

Explain why your track fits their curation style

Offer exclusive content for successful placements

Personal touch beats template emails consistently

**Tweet 3:** Music blog coverage drives 40% more streams than ads

Editorial credibility creates lasting audience impact

Target blogs covering similar artists recently

Offer exclusive interviews or behind-scenes content

Provide high-quality images and press materials

Editorial coverage compounds, advertising fades

## PERSONAL TWEETS (Authentic Voice)

**Tweet 1:** Been radio promoting for 5 years and still get nervous pitching new tracks

The difference now? I built the tools that remind me when to follow up

Anxiety doesn't disappear. Systems just make it manageable

**Tweet 2:** The kids ask what I do for work

"I help musicians get heard, and I make computer programs"

Still not sure they understand, but they're proud anyway

Simple explanations are the hardest ones

**Tweet 3:** Spent £2k on music marketing tools last year

Every single one had features I didn't need and missed ones I did

That's why I'm building Total Audio Promo

Frustration drives the best innovation

**Tweet 4:** Daughter asked why I'm always on the laptop

"I'm helping musicians like daddy get heard"

She said "okay daddy" and went back to her drawing

Kids are patient, but I really need to find better balance

## VIBE CODING & CURSOR POSTS (Technical Expertise)

**Post 1:** From Vibe Coder to Production Builder

Started building Total Audio Promo prototypes in Vibe Code.

Rapid iteration. Visual feedback. No technical barriers.

But here's what I learned:

Vibe coding is brilliant for validation.

Production systems need proper development.

The transition taught me everything:

**Prototype Phase (Vibe Code)**

- Test concepts rapidly

- Get stakeholder feedback immediately

- Iterate without technical debt

- Validate user workflows visually

**Production Phase (Cursor + Claude Code)**

- Professional codebase architecture

- Scalable database design

- Proper authentication systems

- Enterprise-grade security

The magic happens when you combine both:

- Vibe Code for rapid concept testing

- Cursor for professional implementation

- Claude Code for intelligent assistance

Don't choose between speed and quality.

Use the right tool for each phase.

What's your workflow for moving from prototype to production?

**Post 2:** Why Cursor + Claude Code Changed Everything

Just shipped a new feature in 2 hours that would've taken 2 days before.

The difference? Cursor IDE with Claude Code integration.

Here's how my development workflow evolved:

**Before:**

- Write code manually

- Debug line by line

- Google Stack Overflow constantly

- Struggle with unfamiliar syntax

**After (Cursor + Claude):**

- Describe what I want in plain English

- Claude generates code suggestions

- Cursor handles the implementation

- Real-time debugging assistance

Example from yesterday:

Me: "Create an automated email sequence that personalises based on contact's recent playlist additions"

Claude: Generates complete TypeScript function with error handling

Cursor: Integrates perfectly with existing codebase

Result: Feature shipped in one session instead of multiple days.

This isn't about replacing developers.

It's about amplifying productivity.

AI-assisted coding lets me focus on business logic instead of syntax debugging.

More time solving problems.

Less time fighting tools.

What development workflow change had the biggest impact on your productivity?
