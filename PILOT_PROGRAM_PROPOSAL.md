**What's Excluded (Not Tested During Pilot):**

- Full team rollout (40+ freelancers) - pilot is 3 people only
- Press and playlist contacts (pilot focuses on BBC Radio)

---

### Campaign Selection Criteria

**Ideal Campaigns for Pilot:**

**Campaign 1: Active Radio Campaign**
- BBC Radio focus (R1, 6 Music, Introducing)
- Indie/alternative or rock genre (good BBC Radio fit)
- Artist with strong story/hook (easier to pitch)
- 8-12 week timeline (standard campaign)

**Campaign 2: Upcoming Radio Campaign**
- Different genre (test AI pitch versatility)
- New artist to Sam's team (test contact research value)
- Coordinated with multiple team members (test Campaign Tracker)

**Why These Criteria:**
- Real campaigns = real results (not artificial test)
- BBC Radio focus = plays to Total Audio Promo's strength
- Different genres = demonstrates versatility
- Multiple team members = tests coordination features

## Risk Mitigation & Guarantees

### Liberty's Risk Assessment

**What Liberty Risks:**
- £500 investment
- 4 weeks of team time (Sam + 2 freelancers testing new tools)
- Potential disruption if tools don't work

**What Total Audio Promo Risks:**
- 4 weeks of intensive support time
- Discounted pricing (£500 vs £2,000)
- Risk of Liberty saying no after pilot (no guaranteed conversion)

**Risk Mitigation for Liberty:**

**1. Money-Back Satisfaction Guarantee**
"If after Week 2, Sam's team genuinely hates the tools, we'll refund the full £500. No questions asked."

**2. Data Ownership & Export**
"All data entered during pilot (contacts, campaigns, notes) exports to CSV at any time. If you cancel, you keep everything."

**3. No Long-Term Contract**
"Pilot ends after 4 weeks. No automatic billing. We discuss next steps, you decide. No pressure."

**4. Minimal Disruption Guarantee**
"If the tools break or don't work, Sam's team can continue with their existing workflow (spreadsheets). We're adding a tool, not replacing your ability to work."

## Pilot Success Story Template

### If Pilot Succeeds, This is the Narrative:

**"How Liberty Music PR Saved 17 Hours Per Campaign with Total Audio Promo"**

> "We were skeptical that a tool could save us 15 hours of contact research per campaign. But after the 4-week pilot, we tracked every minute. Audio Intel reduced our BBC Radio research from 15 hours to 30 seconds. The Pitch Generator gave our team AI-powered first drafts that took 15 minutes to refine instead of 2-3 hours to write from scratch.
>
> Across 2 campaigns in the pilot, we saved 34 hours - worth over £1,000 at our team's hourly rate. For a £500 pilot investment, that's 200% ROI in the first month.
>
> Now we're rolling it out to our full team of 40+ freelancers. The time savings let us take on more clients without burning out our team."
>
> **— Sam Jones, Head of Press & Radio, Liberty Music PR**
