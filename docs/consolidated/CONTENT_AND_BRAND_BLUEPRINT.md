# Content, Brand, and Marketing Blueprint

_Unified reference for brand positioning, messaging, design, and campaign execution._

## 1. Brand Positioning & Story

- UK-built, radio-promo-proven platform delivering verified contacts without submission fees.
- Authentic British voice: professional but candid, grounded in founder’s 5+ years of radio promotion and the “dad building tools he actually uses” story from the AI Audience Accelerator profile.
- Core promise: "Stop paying €3–15 per submission. Get verified contacts directly and keep your creative time."
- Differentiation levers: credibility (BBC Radio 1/Spotify case studies), transparent dashboards, affordable subscriptions.
- Personal narrative pillars: balancing family life with night-time builds, headphones-over-suits practicality, honest talk about what works/what doesn’t.

## 2. Messaging Pillars

1. **Credible Outcomes** – show real campaign transformations (15 hours → 15 minutes, Liberty churn insights, organic stream guarantees).
2. **Automation With Personality** – AI agents that feel human, support content creation and campaign workflows.
3. **UK Industry Insider** – local knowledge, contact intelligence, and support tailored to British independent artists and agencies.
4. **Accessible Pricing** – highlight £19/£79 tiers vs. expensive agency retainers and pay-per-pitch platforms.
5. **Real-life builder** – weave in Chris’s dual-role context (freelance radio promoter + sadact producer + parent) so content feels grounded.

## 3. Content Strategy

### Always-On Channels

- **LinkedIn**: Industry analysis, Liberty competitive insights, Audio Intel updates.
- **Twitter/X**: Quick wins, product changelog, metrics snapshots.
- **Instagram**: Behind-the-scenes, agent spotlights, customer testimonials.
- **YouTube**: Product demos, demo session replays, contact enrichment walkthroughs.

### Campaign Assets

- Landing page copy emphasising verified contacts and organic growth guarantees.
- Email sequences:
  - Onboarding (align price references, rebuild with new API token).
  - Product updates & roadmap reveal.
  - Retention nudges (usage summaries, new dataset drops).
- Sales collateral: case studies (BBC Radio 1, Spotify), comparison charts vs. Liberty/Groover/SubmitHub.
- Emotional drivers deck: 10 frustrations / wants / dreams / fears pulled from the AI Audience Accelerator doc to feed future content matrices.

### Weekly Priorities (Current Sprint)

1. Refresh landing page copy with anti-Liberty positioning and freemium messaging.
2. Publish LinkedIn post launching Audio Intel beta with testimonial clip.
3. Build outreach templates (radio promoters, agencies, artist DIY cohort).
4. Produce product demo video capturing live enrichment.
5. Reuse the “Current Priorities & To-Dos” board content as a weekly status update (Twitter thread + LinkedIn carousel) so audiences see the grind.

## 4. Visual System

- Updated palette with Command Centre slate foundation plus product-specific accents (Audio Intel blue, Playlist Pulse green, etc.).
- Texture approach: DRS paper overlays with <20% opacity gradients for depth; WebP assets <50 KB.
- Typography: Maintain hierarchy consistent with Command Centre and Audio Intel UI (Sans-serif for body, accent type for headings).
- Toolkits: Social templates, email headers, dashboard screenshots—standardise around new palette and texture system.

## 5. Content Operations & Automation

- **Agents in use**: Music Marketing Mastermind, Viral Content Automation, Content Commander; ensure they reference this blueprint for tone and structure.
- **Workflow**: Quarterly brand review → monthly campaign plan → weekly content calendar (automated scheduling with Buffer/Later) → analytics retro.
- **Analytics**: Track content-driven demo bookings, newsletter growth (+25/month target), social engagement, and retention triggered by success story touchpoints.
- **Automation Fixes**: Resolve Kit API 401 errors, reconnect forms, align price references before campaign relaunch.

## 6. Asset Repository & Next Actions

- Consolidated sources: `tmp/notion-export/content-brand.md`, `tmp/notion-export/content-bank-authentic-voice-master.md`, `tmp/notion-export/content-commander-agent-command-centre-integration.md`, `tmp/notion-export/updated-total-audio-brand-guidelines-command-centre-era.md`, `docs/archive/marketing-mastermind.md`, `docs/archive/viral-content.md`.
- Immediate tasks:
  1. Update all email/landing assets with refined positioning and palette.
  2. Record demo walkthrough for YouTube and embed on landing page.
  3. Publish Liberty competitive breakdown as lead magnet / carousel.
  4. Schedule cross-platform campaign using Viral Content Automation template.
  5. Mine the AI Audience Accelerator profile for copy blocks about motivations, frustrations, and use them in nurture sequences.

## 7. Governance & Tone Checklist

- Use UK spelling and industry terminology (e.g., “programme”, “licensing”).
- Keep narrative personal—highlight founder’s dual life (family + 2am coding) when relevant.
- Ensure every asset links back to measurable outcomes (stream quality, hours saved, cost savings).
- Avoid resurrecting outdated “Muck Rack vs. Cision” messaging; anchor to real competitors indie artists recognise.
