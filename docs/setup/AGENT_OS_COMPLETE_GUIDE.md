# AGENT OS - COMPLETE USAGE GUIDE

_Your comprehensive guide to using Agent OS effectively for Audio Intel development_

## WHAT IS AGENT OS?

Agent OS transforms AI coding agents (like me, Claude) from "confused interns into productive developers" by providing:

- **Structured workflows**for product development
- **Clear standards**for code quality and architecture
- **Business context**so agents understand your goals
- **Proven patterns**for building software systematically

### Why It Matters for Audio Intel

- **Customer acquisition focus**- All development aligned with business goals
- **Quality consistency**- Every feature meets professional standards
- **Faster development**- Clear patterns vs figuring it out each time
- **Business-driven decisions**- Technical choices support revenue goals

## AGENT OS COMMANDS (Your New Superpowers)

### Available Commands in Claude Code

```bash
/plan-product      # Set mission & roadmap for new product
/analyze-product   # Analyze existing product (perfect for Audio Intel!)
/create-spec       # Create detailed feature specifications
/execute-tasks     # Build and ship code systematically
```

## STEP-BY-STEP USAGE GUIDE

### 1. ANALYZE YOUR EXISTING PRODUCT

**When to use**: Perfect for understanding your current Audio Intel state

**Command**: `/analyze-product`

**What it does**:

- Reviews your current Audio Intel product
- Identifies strengths and improvement opportunities
- Creates comprehensive product analysis
- Sets up context for future development

**Example usage**:

```
/analyze-product

# Agent OS will:
# 1. Read your AUDIO_INTEL_CONTEXT.md
# 2. Review your codebase structure
# 3. Understand your customer segments
# 4. Create comprehensive product analysis
# 5. Identify next development priorities
```

### 2. CREATE FEATURE SPECIFICATIONS

**When to use**: Before building any new feature or improvement

**Command**: `/create-spec`

**What it does**:

- Creates detailed technical specifications
- Ensures features align with customer acquisition goals
- Defines success criteria and testing approaches
- Plans implementation steps

**Example usage**:

```
/create-spec

# Tell Agent OS what you want:
# "I want to improve the demo experience for radio promoters"
# "I need a referral system for existing customers"
# "I want to optimize the contact enrichment for mobile"

# Agent OS will create detailed spec covering:
# - User requirements and acceptance criteria
# - Technical implementation approach
# - Testing strategy
# - Success metrics
```

### 3. EXECUTE TASKS SYSTEMATICALLY

**When to use**: After you have a spec, ready to build

**Command**: `/execute-tasks`

**What it does**:

- Builds features following Agent OS best practices
- Maintains focus on customer acquisition goals
- Ensures mobile-first development
- Includes proper testing and validation

**Example usage**:

```
/execute-tasks

# Agent OS will:
# 1. Review your current priorities (WEEKLY_FOCUS.md)
# 2. Check business context (AUDIO_INTEL_CONTEXT.md)
# 3. Build features that support customer acquisition
# 4. Ensure mobile compatibility
# 5. Include proper testing
# 6. Update documentation
```

### 4. PLAN NEW PRODUCT FEATURES

**When to use**: When expanding Audio Intel or planning new tools

**Command**: `/plan-product`

**What it does**:

- Creates product roadmap aligned with business goals
- Prioritizes features based on customer acquisition impact
- Ensures technical feasibility
- Plans development phases

## PRACTICAL AGENT OS WORKFLOWS

### Morning Development Session

**1. Check Current Priorities**

```bash
code WEEKLY_FOCUS.md
# Review today's technical priorities
```

**2. Analyze Current State**

```bash
/analyze-product
# Get comprehensive view of Audio Intel status
```

**3. Create Specification**

```bash
/create-spec
# For whatever you're building today
# Example: "Improve demo booking conversion rate"
```

**4. Execute Development**

```bash
/execute-tasks
# Build the feature systematically
```

### Customer-Driven Development Workflow

**Scenario**: Radio promoter feedback says demo booking is confusing

**Step 1**: Update business context

```bash
code BUSINESS_NOTES.md
# Add: "Radio promoter feedback: demo booking process unclear"
```

**Step 2**: Create improvement spec

```bash
/create-spec
# "Streamline demo booking process for radio promoters"
# Agent OS will create detailed specification
```

**Step 3**: Execute improvement

```bash
/execute-tasks
# Build the improvement with proper testing
```

**Step 4**: Update progress

```bash
code WEEKLY_FOCUS.md
# Mark task completed, note impact on conversion rate
```

## AGENT OS BEST PRACTICES

### 1. Always Start with Business Context

**Before any development**:

- Check `WEEKLY_FOCUS.md` for current priorities
- Reference `AUDIO_INTEL_CONTEXT.md` for customer context
- Ask: "Will this help get the first paying customer?"

### 2. Use Agent OS for All Non-Trivial Development

**Use Agent OS when**:

- Building new features
- Making significant improvements
- Planning development phases
- Need systematic approach

**Don't use Agent OS for**:

- Simple bug fixes
- Minor text changes
- Quick experiments

### 3. Leverage Business-Driven Development

**Agent OS knows your business**:

- Customer acquisition phase focus
- Radio promoter priority (85% conversion)
- Mobile-first requirements
- Revenue targets and timelines

### 4. Follow the Full Workflow

**Complete cycle**:

1. `/analyze-product` - Understand current state
2. `/create-spec` - Plan the feature properly
3. `/execute-tasks` - Build systematically
4. Update progress in `WEEKLY_FOCUS.md`

## AUDIO INTEL SPECIFIC EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Improve Demo Conversion Rate

**Problem**: Demo calls not converting to trials

**Agent OS Workflow**:

```bash
# 1. Analyze current state
/analyze-product
# Reviews current demo process, identifies issues

# 2. Create improvement spec
/create-spec
# "Optimize demo call experience for radio promoter conversion"

# 3. Execute systematic improvement
/execute-tasks
# Builds improved demo flow, mobile optimization, follow-up automation
```

### Example 2: Add Referral System

**Business need**: Scale customer acquisition through existing users

**Agent OS Workflow**:

```bash
# 1. Create feature specification
/create-spec
# "Build referral system for Audio Intel customers"
# Agent OS creates detailed spec considering:
# - Customer segments (radio promoters, artists, agencies)
# - Integration with existing payment system
# - Mobile experience requirements
# - Analytics and tracking needs

# 2. Execute development
/execute-tasks
# Builds complete referral system following spec
```

### Example 3: Mobile Experience Optimization

**Customer feedback**: Mobile demo experience needs improvement

**Agent OS Workflow**:

```bash
# 1. Analyze current mobile experience
/analyze-product
# Reviews mobile UX, identifies specific issues

# 2. Create mobile optimization spec
/create-spec
# "Optimize Audio Intel mobile demo experience"

# 3. Execute mobile improvements
/execute-tasks
# Improves mobile UX with proper testing
```

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### 1. Skipping the Analysis Step

**Wrong**: Jump straight to `/execute-tasks`
**Right**: Start with `/analyze-product` to understand context

### 2. Not Updating Business Context

**Wrong**: Agent OS works with stale information
**Right**: Keep `WEEKLY_FOCUS.md` and `AUDIO_INTEL_CONTEXT.md` current

### 3. Ignoring Business Priorities

**Wrong**: Build features that sound cool but don't help customers
**Right**: Always ask "Will this help get the first paying customer?"

### 4. Not Following the Full Workflow

**Wrong**: Create spec but skip systematic execution
**Right**: Use complete `/create-spec` → `/execute-tasks` workflow
