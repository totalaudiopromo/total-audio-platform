## 🎨 CLAUDE MAX USE CASES FOR YOU

### 1. **Strategic Planning Sessions**

**Best Time**: Monday morning, quarterly planning

**Ask Claude**:

```
"Based on Audio Intel's current state (0 paying customers, £19/£79 pricing,
100% enrichment success rate, BBC Radio 1 case study), create a 4-week
customer acquisition plan to hit £500/month by November 2025."
```

**Why Max Plan**: Long strategic conversations with context retention

### 2. **Feature Development (TDD Workflow)**

**Best Time**: Your 2-hour focused development sessions

**Ask Claude**:

```
"Using the TDD workflow, build a referral system for Audio Intel that:
- Tracks referral links
- Shows referrer dashboard
- Gives 20% commission
- Works on mobile
- Integrates with Stripe"
```

**Why Max Plan**: Complex multi-step development without hitting limits

### 3. **Customer Acquisition Content**

**Best Time**: Content creation days (batch 1 week of content)

**Ask Claude**:

```
"Generate a week of customer acquisition content:
- 5 LinkedIn posts (radio promoter focus)
- 3 Twitter threads (BBC Radio 1 case study)
- 2 email campaigns (cold outreach)
- 1 blog post (contact enrichment guide)

Use my authentic voice (Brighton producer, sadact, BBC Radio 1 experience)
and focus on the 85% radio promoter conversion rate."
```

**Why Max Plan**: Large content generation without interruption

### 4. **Agent Development & Optimization**

**Best Time**: Agent system improvements

**Ask Claude**:

```
"Review all 14 agents in Agent OS and:
1. Identify redundancies
2. Suggest consolidations
3. Propose 3 new agents for customer acquisition
4. Update unified-launcher with improvements"
```

**Why Max Plan**: Deep system analysis across multiple files

### 5. **Bug Fixing & Debugging**

**Best Time**: When things break (always happens)

**Ask Claude**:

```
"Audio Intel contact enrichment is failing for BBC emails. Debug the entire
pipeline from frontend → API → Perplexity → database and fix all issues."
```

**Why Max Plan**: Multi-file debugging with full context

### 6. **Database & Schema Changes**

**Best Time**: When adding features that need data changes

**Ask Claude**:

```
"Add referral tracking to the database:
1. Design Prisma schema changes
2. Create migration
3. Update API routes
4. Test with Neon database
5. Document the changes"
```

## 💡 PRO TIPS FOR MAX PLAN

### 1. **Use Long Context Windows**

Instead of:
❌ "Fix this bug" (no context)

Do:
✅ "Here's the full Audio Intel enrichment pipeline [paste 5 files]. The bug
is that BBC Radio 1 emails fail enrichment. Debug and fix."

**Max Plan Advantage**: Can handle massive context

### 2. **Chain Complex Tasks**

Instead of:
❌ Single simple requests

Do:
✅ "Build referral system: design schema → create migration → build API →
create UI → add mobile support → write tests → deploy to staging →
document for users"

**Max Plan Advantage**: Won't timeout on multi-step workflows

### 3. **Iterate Without Starting Over**

Instead of:
❌ New conversation for each iteration

Do:
✅ Keep same conversation, iterate:

- "Now add commission tracking"
- "Make it work on mobile"
- "Add email notifications"

**Max Plan Advantage**: Context retention through iterations

### 4. **Use Agent OS Integration**

Instead of:
❌ Manual agent running

Do:
✅ "Use Agent OS to generate newsletter content, social media posts, and
cold outreach emails for this week. Run the agents and compile results."

**Max Plan Advantage**: Can coordinate multiple agent runs

### 5. **Batch Similar Work**

Instead of:
❌ One email at a time

Do:
✅ "Generate 20 cold outreach emails for radio promoters, personalized by:

- Station size (local, regional, national)
- Genre focus (electronic, indie, mainstream)
- Previous BBC Radio 1 experience mention"

**Max Plan Advantage**: Large batch processing
