# Inspiration Drop Zone

A dedicated directory for saving screenshots, mood boards, and planning artefacts that inform Total Audio projects. Keep everything in UK spelling where possible.

## Suggested Structure
- `screenshots/` – Raw visual inspiration, e.g. UI ideas and branding references.
- `notes/` – Quick markdown summaries explaining why each asset matters.
- `plans/` – Early sketches, mind maps, or brainstorming outcomes.

Feel free to adapt the subfolders as required. Add short captions or README files so future you always remembers the context behind each asset.
