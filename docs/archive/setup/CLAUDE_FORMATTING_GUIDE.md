## **Visual Organization Rules**

### **1. Consistent Spacing**

- Separate bullet points properly
- Break up long text blocks

### **2. Clear Hierarchy**  
- # for main sections
- ## for subsections  
- ### for detailed points
- **Bold** for emphasis

### **3. Scannable Content**
- Use bullet points for lists
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences)
- Add visual breaks with lines (---)

### **4. Color-Coded Categories**
- 🟦 Business Strategy
- 🟩 Technical Development  
- 🟨 Workflow Management
- 🟪 Project-Specific

## **Agent Reference Format**

Instead of long paragraphs, use:

**🟦 Business Strategy**
`Use music-industry-strategist for market analysis`

**🟩 Technical Development**  
`Use full-stack-music-tech for API guidance`

**🟨 Workflow Management**
`Apply music-promo-workflow for campaigns`

This creates clear, scannable, professionally formatted output.
