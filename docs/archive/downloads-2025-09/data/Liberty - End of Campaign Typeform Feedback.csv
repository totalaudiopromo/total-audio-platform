I appreciate the quick response and professional pitch from the A&R during the initial engagement. Settling the campaign service fees promptly demonstrated my commitment to the campaign. However, the delay in starting the campaign was concerning and led me to question the legitimacy of the service, which eroded my trust in the beginning and impacted my confidence in the campaign.   Press Nathan kept the lines of communication open, promptly responding to my queries and providing updates every Friday. His efforts secured placements in prominent publications like ""Wonderland"" and ""Music Crowns,"" among other notable media outlets. Seeing my music featured on such reputable platforms was a dream come true. I believe there is still untapped potential to explore and target even broader press coverage and I look forward to future opportunities to work together and continue spreading the message of my music to an even broader audience.  Playlisting Rich's dedication to providing consistent updates on playlisting placements as promised is commendable, and I genuinely appreciate the effort put into the campaign. However, I must be honest and admit that the results of the playlisting campaign fell below my initial expectations. One area that I believe could have been improved is the timing of playlist placements. Not having my lead single, ""Survive The Night,"" playlisted on its release day was a missed opportunity. As we know, the first day of release is when the majority of listeners pay attention to a new track, and having it featured on playlists from the get-go could have significantly boosted its visibility. Additionally, I had hoped for playlisting in Spotify editorial playlists, which unfortunately did not materialize. It's worth considering ways to strengthen our approach to securing placements in these highly influential playlists, as they can have a substantial impact on an artist's exposure. Furthermore, while there was mention of Apple Music playlist pitching during the campaign discussions, we did not receive any placements there. To ensure more comprehensive coverage in the future, exploring strategies to secure playlisting across multiple platforms, including Apple Music, would be beneficial.  To be clear, I am grateful for the effort put into the playlisting campaign, but I believe there is room for improvement. I hope that in our future collaborations, we can work together to refine the approach and achieve even better results. As an artist investing in my debut album, ""MatterMoreForSis,"" I'm eager to explore all avenues to maximize its exposure and reach a broader audience.  Thank you once again for your hard work and dedication. I look forward to discussing ways to enhance the playlisting strategy and further promote the album's music in our future endeavors.  Overall, my experience working with your agency on the promotion of my debut album, ""MatterMoreForSis,"" had both positive and challenging aspects. I appreciate the quick response and professional pitch from Dan during the initial engagement. Settling the campaign service fees promptly demonstrated my commitment to the campaign, and I am grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with your team. However, the delay in curating the campaign team was concerning and led me to question the legitimacy of the service. This initial setback eroded my trust in the beginning and impacted my confidence in the campaign's success. Moving forward, I would recommend streamlining the onboarding process and minimizing any delays to ensure a smoother and more reassuring experience for artists.  Despite this initial hurdle, I must acknowledge the efforts put forth during the campaign. Nathan kept the lines of communication open, promptly responding to my queries and providing updates every Friday. His efforts secured placements in prominent publications like ""Wonderland"" and ""Music Crowns,"" among other notable media outlets. Seeing my music featured on such reputable platforms was a dream come true.

Looking ahead, I would suggest fostering more open communication and transparency from the beginning to the end of the campaign process. Regular progress updates, transparent discussions on strategy, and timely responses to any concerns would significantly strengthen the artist-agency relationship and instill confidence in the campaign's progress. I remain enthusiastic about working with your agency and believe that, with strategic adjustments and enhanced communication, we can achieve even greater success in promoting my music.
