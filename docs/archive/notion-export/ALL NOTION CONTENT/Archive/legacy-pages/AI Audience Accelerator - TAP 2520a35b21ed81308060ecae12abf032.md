## My Context - Chris Schofield

### What do you do?

I'm Chris Schofield - dad of two who produces electronic music as sadact and works as a freelance radio promoter. I'm building Total Audio Promo, an AI-powered music promotion platform that eliminates the 94% of repetitive tasks that are killing creativity in the music industry. I split my time between making my own music, getting other artists' tracks on radio, and building the tools I wish existed when I started out.

### What's your offer?

I'm creating a two-tier ecosystem that fixes music marketing from the ground up. For independent artists, I offer [studio.totalaudiopromo.com](http://studio.totalaudiopromo.com) (£25-£85/month) - affordable tools that actually work for bedroom producers and emerging talent. For PR agencies and labels, there's the full Total Audio Promo platform (£250-£850/month) that automates the soul-crushing manual work that's burning out industry professionals.

The first tool, Audio Intel, is already live - it's contact enrichment that actually understands the music industry. Everything I build gets tested in my own campaigns first.

### What do you talk about?

Music marketing is fundamentally broken. We're using generic business tools for a creative industry, paying enterprise prices for basic features, and watching talented artists give up because promotion feels impossible. I talk about fixing this - how AI can handle the boring stuff so artists can focus on making great music. I share real insights from working in radio promotion, the gaps I see in current tools, and how technology should serve creativity, not complicate it.

I also talk about the realities of being a working parent in the music industry, building tools while using them professionally, and why the UK music scene needs better promotion infrastructure.

### What did you do in the past?

I've been producing electronic music as sadact for years - I know the frustration of spending more time on spreadsheets than in the studio. I've worked as a freelance radio promoter, pitching tracks to radio programmers and learning exactly which contacts matter and which don't. I've seen agencies drowning in manual processes, using 10+ disconnected tools, and burning out talented people with tasks that should be automated.

Before this, I was navigating the same struggles every independent artist faces - limited budget, no industry connections, and tools that weren't built for musicians.

### What are you interested in?

I'm fascinated by the intersection of creativity and technology - specifically how AI can eliminate the barriers between artists and their audience. I'm interested in building sustainable businesses that actually help people rather than extracting value from them. I care about the UK music scene having world-class tools instead of being dependent on expensive US platforms.

I'm also interested in authentic marketing - showing real results from real campaigns rather than manufactured success stories. And as a dad, I'm interested in building something meaningful that my kids can be proud of.

### How would you describe yourself?

I'm a realist who builds solutions to problems I actually have. I don't do marketing fluff - if something works, I'll tell you exactly how and why. If it doesn't, I'll be honest about that too. I'm someone who wears headphones more than suits, who tests everything in real campaigns before talking about it, and who believes the best tools come from people who actually use them.

I'm a dad trying to balance family life with building something that matters. I'm a producer who gets frustrated with broken workflows. I'm a radio promoter who knows which contacts are gold and which are time-wasters. And I'm someone who thinks the music industry deserves better than what we currently have.

Most importantly, I'm building this for the artist I was five years ago - talented, driven, but completely lost in the promotion maze. Every feature exists because I needed it. Every workflow is tested because I use it. This isn't just another SaaS tool - it's professional software built by someone who lives this daily.

## My Audience Context

### Who's your audience?

My audience consists of two distinct but interconnected groups in the UK music industry. First, independent artists - bedroom producers, singer-songwriters, and emerging bands who are talented but struggling to cut through the noise without major label resources. Second, music PR agencies and industry professionals who are drowning in manual processes and burning out from repetitive tasks that should be automated.

### What characterizes them?

**Independent Artists:**

- They're creatively driven but promotion-frustrated
- Limited budgets (typically £25-£100/month for marketing tools)
- Time-poor - they want to spend time making music, not managing spreadsheets
- Technically capable but not necessarily marketing experts
- Hungry for genuine industry insights and authentic connections
- Skeptical of expensive enterprise tools that don't understand music
- Based primarily in the UK but with global ambitions

**PR Agencies & Industry Professionals:**

- Experienced music industry workers feeling overwhelmed by manual processes
- Managing multiple artists simultaneously with tight deadlines
- Frustrated by using 10+ disconnected tools that don't talk to each other
- Budget-conscious but willing to pay for genuine efficiency gains (£250-£850/month)
- Results-driven and accountable to clients for measurable outcomes
- Time-strapped and looking for ways to scale without hiring more staff
- Seeking competitive advantages in an increasingly crowded market

### What do they do?

**Independent Artists:**

- Create and release music across electronic, indie, and alternative genres
- Spend countless hours manually building contact lists and pitching tracks
- Juggle creative work with promotion, often poorly
- Post on social media without clear strategy or measurement
- Submit to playlists and blogs with low response rates
- Dream of radio play but don't know how to approach stations professionally
- Waste money on generic marketing tools that don't understand music industry workflows

**PR Agencies & Industry Professionals:**

- Manage promotional campaigns for multiple artists simultaneously
- Manually update client reports and track campaign performance across platforms
- Build and maintain contact databases that quickly become outdated
- Coordinate release timelines and media outreach with tight deadlines
- Struggle with client communication and expectation management
- Work late nights and weekends to keep up with manual administrative tasks
- Constantly evaluate new tools but find most aren't built for music industry needs

Both groups share a common frustration: they know music marketing could be more efficient, but the current tools and processes are either too expensive, too generic, or simply don't understand how the music industry actually works. They're looking for someone who gets it - someone who's been in their shoes and built solutions from real experience rather than corporate theory.

## Customer Research Prompt - Completed for Total Audio Promo

### Filled-in Prompt:

I want you to do customer research for me.

Tell me 10 frustrations, 10 desires, 10 dreams, and 10 fears that my audience experiences related to **Music Marketing & Promotion**.

Here's some information about my target audience:

**My audience consists of two distinct but interconnected groups in the UK music industry. First, independent artists - bedroom producers, singer-songwriters, and emerging bands who are talented but struggling to cut through the noise without major label resources. Second, music PR agencies and industry professionals who are drowning in manual processes and burning out from repetitive tasks that should be automated.**

- Results-driven and accountable to clients for measurable outcomes
- Time-strapped and looking for ways to scale without hiring more staff
- Seeking competitive advantages in an increasingly crowded market

The frustrations and desires should come in pairs and be opposites.

The dreams and fears should come in pairs and be opposites.

For example, if the frustration is "Struggles to attract and retain customers due to the perceived complexity and technical nature of AI solutions", the paired want would be "attracts and retains many customers because they've explained their complex product in a simple-to-understand way"

Include results that are specific to the industry and business model. Be as specific as you can.

Format the output of the 10 frustrations, 10 wants, 10 dreams, and 10 fears in a table.

The x axis should be numbered one to ten the y axis should include desire, frustration, dream and fear.

## Content Strategy Matrix Prompt - Completed for Total Audio Promo

### Filled-in Prompt:

I want you to create a Content Strategy for me.

A Content Strategy is a document that describes a brand's social media strategy so it know what to create content around - and what not.

It's like a North Star for the brand's content: it's specific enough to serve as a guiding and reassuring document, but vague enough to leave some room for interpretation.

The brand I want you to create a Content Strategy for is **Chris Schofield - dad of two who produces electronic music as sadact and works as a freelance radio promoter. I'm building Total Audio Promo, an AI-powered music promotion platform that eliminates the 94% of repetitive tasks that are killing creativity in the music industry.

To create a content strategy, I want you to imagine a "Content Strategy Matrix" with an x and y axis.

1 Growth content - to get eyeballs

This is the type of content that goes viral on social media all the time.

It's contains relatively basic information, doesn't provide any unique value, but that's precisely why it works so well:

It's beginner-friendly content that promises a "quick fix", and often appeals to the reader's fear of missing out, innate human needs (status, money, etc).

When creating good growth content, you want to ask yourself: how can I position my content as the small effort that is standing between the reader and a big benefit that appeals to as many people as possible?

- --

2 Knowledge content - to get fans

Knowledge content educates your audience on something specific.

It is much deeper and precise than Growth content, so it appeals to a more specific audience, and solves one specific problem for them.

This actionable and informational content teaches your reader one of 2 things:

a) How to get something they really desire

b) How to avoid something they really don't like

This content works because when you you solve people's problems, they start liking you.

The key to creating good knowledge content is being aware of the problems and desires of the audience you're talking to, and then to produce the world's most valuable content for exactly that target audience.

- --

3 Authority content - to get authority

Authority content makes your audience trust your expertise by giving them reasons to trust you, commonly through social proof.

Because even if someone knows & likes you, they won't buy from you unless they trust in your ability to help them.

Common ways to do this are:

- Sharing testimonials
- Sharing achievements
- Sharing other social proof
- Sharing extremely-specific knowledge content

Authority content works well when it subtly addresses the big inner desire the reader has. It should give the reader the inner feeling of hope, and feel like "if this creator has proof that they helped someone else who's exactly like me, perhaps they can really help me"

- --

## on the y axis, you have my 3 content buckets, the things I have expertise in:

1 **AI-Powered Music Marketing Tools**

2 **Radio Promotion & Industry Relationships**

3 **Independent Artist Development & Success**

- 

Now, I want you to create a Content Strategy by filling out the matrix.

Fill out the matrix by applying each of the 3 proven content formats from the x axis to the 3 content buckets on the y axis.

The output should be formatted in a table, so that each resulting matrix field has a **bolded** headline describing it, with 2 sentences below explaining the component of the content strategy.

After outputting the table, suggest 2 content ideas for each component of the Content Strategy.

### Key Elements Used:

- **[1. GIVE CONTEXT]:** Your complete authentic personal and business context
- **[2. TARGET AUDIENCE]:** Your dual audience (independent artists + PR agencies)
- **[3. TOPIC 1]:** AI-Powered Music Marketing Tools
- **[3. TOPIC 2]:** Radio Promotion & Industry Relationships
- **[3. TOPIC 3]:** Independent Artist Development & Success

This will create a 3x3 matrix (9 content types total) that covers every angle of your expertise with the right content format for maximum growth, engagement, and monetization.

## Content Idea Generator Prompt - Completed for Total Audio Promo

### Filled-in Prompt:

Well done.

Now, based on the Content Strategy Matrix you generated for me, I need your help with generating irresistible ideas for content that will be used as Twitter threads.

My primary goal with my content is to **be seen as the go-to authority for music marketing solutions among UK independent artists and PR agencies, while building trust through authentic industry experience and demonstrating that AI can fix the broken music promotion system**.

I don't talk about **generic business advice, non-music related AI tools, cryptocurrency, NFTs, or theoretical marketing strategies that haven't been tested in real music campaigns**.

Make sure the scope of each content idea fits a thread.

I have two constraints for my writing:

1) All content ideas need to be actionable, inspirational, or analytical

2) All content ideas need to include at least 1 number

3) Some content ideas should question the status quo, offer a unique perspective or break down a big concept in simpler terms

Please come up with 40 content ideas in total, out of which 15 are for the Growth content type, 15 are for the Knowledge content type, and 10 are for the Authority content type

---

### Key Elements Used:

**[1. EXPLAIN YOUR GOALS]:**

"Be seen as the go-to authority for music marketing solutions among UK independent artists and PR agencies, while building trust through authentic industry experience and demonstrating that AI can fix the broken music promotion system"

**[2. ANYTHING RELATED TO YOUR NICHE THAT YOU DON'T WANT IDEAS ABOUT]:**

"Generic business advice, non-music related AI tools, cryptocurrency, NFTs, or theoretical marketing strategies that haven't been tested in real music campaigns"

### Why These Choices Work:

- Build your authority in music marketing
- Appeal to both independent artists and PR agencies
- Showcase your real industry experience
- Position AI as the solution to music promotion problems
