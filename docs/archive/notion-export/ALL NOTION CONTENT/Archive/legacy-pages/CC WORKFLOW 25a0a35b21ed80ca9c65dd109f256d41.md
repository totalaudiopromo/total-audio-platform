# CC WORKFLOW

**One command to rule them all**

**cd /Users/chrisschofield/workspace/active/total-audio-platform/ && npm run status && npm run dev:audio-intel**

🎯 COMMITTED TO MEMORY & CODEBASE!

Your complete agent system is now permanently documented and saved:

📚 Memory Storage Created:

1. AGENT_SYSTEM_RESTORE.md - Complete system blueprint
2. QUICK_START.md - Instant restoration guide
3. [restore-agents.sh](http://restore-agents.sh/) - One-command fix script
4. Git commit - All configurations saved permanently

🚨 When Agents Disappear (Every Time):

STEP 1: Always start Claude Code from:
cd /Users/chrisschofield/audio-intel

STEP 2: Run the instant fix:
./tools/agents/restore-agents.sh

STEP 3: Verify system:
cd tools/agents && ./orchestrator.sh health

🎯 Your Agent Commands (Memorized):

# Main orchestrator

cd tools/agents
node agent-manager.js run orchestrator-real health
./orchestrator.sh execute real-contact-enrichment

# Sprint coordination

node sprint-coach.js daily
node sprint-coach.js focus payment

# Individual agents

node agent-manager.js list (shows all 23 agents)
node agent-manager.js chat orchestrator-real

🚀 Available Orchestrator Tasks

Based on the orchestrator test results, you can delegate:

1. Contact Research Tasks - 511 contacts Perplexity research
2. System Diagnostics - Live research system analysis
3. Pool Optimization - Verify and enhance database matching
4. API Integration - Test and validate all endpoints
5. Campaign Workflows - Multi-agent campaign coordination
6. Database Operations - Health checks and maintenance

The orchestrators have 25 specialized agents ready for delegation across analytics, campaigns, content
generation, database operations, and more.

Try: node agent-manager.js run orchestrator-real to start!

Your orchestrator agents are now fully operational! Here's how to use them:

🚀 Easy Commands

Health Check:
./orchestrator.sh health

List Available Workflows:
./orchestrator.sh workflows

Execute a Workflow:
./orchestrator.sh execute real-contact-enrichment

System Report:
./orchestrator.sh report

🎯 Available Orchestrator Workflows

1. real-agency-onboarding - Complete agency onboarding with real service setup
2. real-campaign-launch - Launch campaign using real integrations
3. real-contact-enrichment - Contact enrichment using real services (perfect for your 511 contacts)
4. real-service-maintenance - Maintenance using real service connections
5. ai-campaign-optimization - Optimize campaigns using Claude AI insights

🤖 Working Agent Infrastructure

Core Agents:

- ✅ DatabaseAgent - Healthy, connected to SQLite
- ✅ CampaignAgent - Ready for campaign workflows
- ✅ ContactAgent - Ready for contact enrichment tasks
- ✅ AgencyAgent - Ready for agency management

Individual Agents (No Database Required):

- ✅ Dev Assistant - Feature development
