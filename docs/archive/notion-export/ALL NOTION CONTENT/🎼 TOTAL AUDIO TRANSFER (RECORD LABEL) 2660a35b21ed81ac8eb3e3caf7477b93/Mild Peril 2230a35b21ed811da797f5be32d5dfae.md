| Mild Peril is about the anxious feelings you have in your day to day. There’s nothing exclusive to me about these feelings and the fact that they are universal gives me comfort. I wrote this track about two years ago and had it almost finished but it still needed more.. so I added a couple more layers of breaks and had it mixed and mastered with Josh Hunter. What I like about this track is that it’s way different to the rest of the EP. With the vocal sample I used, the lyrics make no sense but it has an emotional pull nonetheless. A fitting end to the EP. | Maribou State fans | _Blue Pastels_ |
