| This one came together quickly. I wanted to make some emotional Garage and stumbled upon a couple of vocal samples. The track is about yearning for someone in the early days of meeting them and I wanted to hit that bittersweet note with it. | I want them to feel emotional 

Excited about the prospect of a new relationship | *Pastel colours*
