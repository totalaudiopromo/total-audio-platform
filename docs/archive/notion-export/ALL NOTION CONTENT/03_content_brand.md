🎵 MUSIC INDUSTRY INSIGHT MONDAY 🎵

Stop wasting your weekends researching radio contacts.

Here is what I learned after 5 years in music PR:

1/ 94% of your research time is spent on outdated info
Only 6% of contacts actually work
That is 14+ hours of wasted effort every week

2/ Generic outreach gets you nowhere
Personalized pitches work 300% better
But you need accurate contact intel first

3/ The average indie artist spends 780 hours annually on research
That is 32+ days of work
Time you could spend creating music

4/ Most artists do not know where to find current contacts
They are using outdated databases and Google searches
Missing the platforms where music professionals actually hang out

5/ The solution? Audio Intel automates this in 2 minutes
Get 94% accurate contact intelligence
Stop wasting your time
Focus on what matters: your music

## TWITTER THREADS (Authentic Voice)

### Thread 1: Why 94% of music marketing tasks can be automated

Right, so this whole music marketing automation thing...

94% of what we do is basically admin work that could be sorted automatically

1/ Contact list building - currently eating 15+ hours a week of my life

Manual research is killing any chance of actually making music tbh

Use AI contact discovery tools

Set automated database updates

Import from verified industry sources

Stop building lists. Start building relationships mate

2/ Email personalisation takes ages for scale tho

Generic pitches get about 2% response rates (brutal)

Use AI to customise subject lines

Automate personal detail insertion

Create template variations by genre

Personalisation at scale beats mass generic outreach

3/ Social media posting eats daily creative time

Inconsistent posting kills algorithmic reach

Schedule content across all platforms

Auto-resize posts for each network

Set up cross-platform syndication

Consistency builds audiences. Automation enables consistency

4/ Campaign tracking requires manual data entry

Spreadsheet updates waste 5+ hours weekly (properly annoying)

Connect analytics APIs automatically

Set up real-time dashboard updates

Create automated performance reports

Data collection should inform decisions, not consume time

5/ Release timeline coordination overwhelms small teams

Missing deadlines kills campaign momentum

Use automated milestone reminders

Set up stakeholder notification systems

Create task dependency workflows

Perfect timing separates successful releases from forgotten ones

6/ Industry relationship management gets lost in chaos

Important contacts fall through manual cracks

Automate follow-up sequences

Set reminder systems for key dates

Track interaction history automatically

Relationships drive careers. Systems preserve relationships

Why 94% of music marketing tasks can be automated:

- Contact discovery
- Email personalisation
- Social media management
- Analytics tracking
- Timeline coordination
- Relationship management

Focus on music. Let technology handle the rest mate

---

## ACTION TWEETS (Authentic Voice)

**Tweet 1:** Radio submission windows close faster than you think

Most stations plan 6-8 weeks ahead for new music

Submit 2 months before target airplay date

Research their typical lead times first

Include multiple format options (clean/explicit)

Early submission beats perfect timing every time

**Tweet 2:** Playlist curator burnout is real and growing tbh

Standing out requires genuine personalisation

Reference their last 3 playlist additions specifically

Explain why your track fits their curation style

Offer exclusive content for successful placements

Personal touch beats template emails consistently

**Tweet 3:** Music blog coverage drives 40% more streams than ads

Editorial credibility creates lasting audience impact

Target blogs covering similar artists recently

Offer exclusive interviews or behind-scenes content

Provide high-quality images and press materials

Editorial coverage compounds, advertising fades

---

## PERSONAL TWEETS (Authentic Voice)

**Tweet 1:** Been radio promoting for 5 years and still get nervous pitching new tracks

The difference now? I built the tools that remind me when to follow up

Anxiety doesn't disappear. Systems just make it manageable

**Tweet 2:** The kids ask what I do for work

"I help musicians get heard, and I make computer programs"

Still not sure they understand, but they're proud anyway

Simple explanations are the hardest ones

**Tweet 3:** Spent £2k on music marketing tools last year

Every single one had features I didn't need and missed ones I did

That's why I'm building Total Audio Promo

Frustration drives the best innovation

**Tweet 4:** Daughter asked why I'm always on the laptop

"I'm helping musicians like daddy get heard"

She said "okay daddy" and went back to her drawing

Kids are patient, but I really need to find better balance

## VIBE CODING & CURSOR POSTS (Technical Expertise)

**Post 1:** From Vibe Coder to Production Builder

Started building Total Audio Promo prototypes in Vibe Code.

Rapid iteration. Visual feedback. No technical barriers.

But here's what I learned:

Vibe coding is brilliant for validation.

Production systems need proper development.

The transition taught me everything:

**Prototype Phase (Vibe Code)**

- Test concepts rapidly
- Get stakeholder feedback immediately
- Iterate without technical debt
- Validate user workflows visually

**Production Phase (Cursor + Claude Code)**

- Professional codebase architecture
- Scalable database design
- Proper authentication systems
- Enterprise-grade security

The magic happens when you combine both:

- Vibe Code for rapid concept testing
- Cursor for professional implementation
- Claude Code for intelligent assistance

Don't choose between speed and quality.

Use the right tool for each phase.

What's your workflow for moving from prototype to production?

**Post 2:** Why Cursor + Claude Code Changed Everything

Just shipped a new feature in 2 hours that would've taken 2 days before.

The difference? Cursor IDE with Claude Code integration.

Here's how my development workflow evolved:

**Before:**

- Write code manually
- Debug line by line
- Google Stack Overflow constantly
- Struggle with unfamiliar syntax

**After (Cursor + Claude):**

- Describe what I want in plain English
- Claude generates code suggestions
- Cursor handles the implementation
- Real-time debugging assistance

Example from yesterday:

Me: "Create an automated email sequence that personalises based on contact's recent playlist additions"

Claude: Generates complete TypeScript function with error handling

Cursor: Integrates perfectly with existing codebase

Result: Feature shipped in one session instead of multiple days.

This isn't about replacing developers.

It's about amplifying productivity.

AI-assisted coding lets me focus on business logic instead of syntax debugging.

More time solving problems.

Less time fighting tools.

What development workflow change had the biggest impact on your productivity?

## Updated Total Audio Brand Guidelines

_Source: 📝 CONTENT & BRAND 2660a35b21ed8162baeaf8afbf100b2e/🎨 UPDATED Total Audio Brand Guidelines - Command C 25d0a35b21ed818981c0f93f53909ee6.md_

# 🎨 UPDATED Total Audio Brand Guidelines - Command Centre Era

*Updated August 2025 - Freemium strategy with refined competitive positioning*

## 🎯 STRATEGIC SHIFT: REAL COMPETITOR ANALYSIS

### WRONG Positioning (Out of Touch):

❌ "UK alternative to Muck Rack and Cision"

❌ "75% cheaper than enterprise tools"

❌ Focus on tools indie artists don't actually use

### CORRECT Positioning (Real World):

✅ "Audio Intel vs SubmitHub: Verified contacts, not playlist gatekeepers"

✅ "Groover alternative: Direct contact intelligence, skip the submission fees"

✅ "What Spotify for Artists and YouTube for Artists don't tell you: who to actually pitch"

### Actual Competitor Landscape:

- **Groover**: €15-29/month submission platform, artists pay per pitch
- **SubmitHub**: $3+ per submission, playlist-focused, hit-or-miss
- **Playlist Push**: $149+ campaigns, expensive for indie budgets
- **Hypeddit**: Social media focused, limited contact intelligence
- **SoundCloud/Bandcamp**: Distribution platforms, no PR intelligence
- **Spotify/YouTube for Artists**: Analytics tools, no contact discovery

### NEW Value Proposition:

**"Stop paying €3-15 per submission. Get verified contacts directly."**

## 🎨 UPDATED COLOUR PALETTE

### Foundation: Grayscale + Texture Base

```css
:root {
  /* Grayscale Foundation */
  --color-base-50: #fafafa;
  --color-base-100: #f8f9fa;  /* Light grey background */
  --color-base-200: #e5e5e5;
  --color-base-300: #d4d4d4;
  --color-base-400: #a3a3a3;
  --color-base-500: #737373;
  --color-base-600: #525252;
  --color-base-700: #404040;
  --color-base-800: #262626;
  --color-base-900: #171717;
  --color-base-950: #0a0a0a;
}
```

### Tool-Specific Colour System

```css
/* Command Center - Neutral Slate (Foundation) */
--color-command-50: #f8fafc;
--color-command-100: #f1f5f9;
--color-command-500: #64748b; /* Primary */
--color-command-600: #475569; /* Hover */
--color-command-900: #0f172a; /* Text */

/* Audio Intel - Professional Blue */
--color-intel-500: #3b82f6; /* Primary */
--color-intel-600: #2563eb; /* Hover */

/* Playlist Pulse - Success Green */
--color-pulse-500: #22c55e; /* Primary */
--color-pulse-600: #16a34a; /* Hover */

/* Release Radar - Campaign Orange */
--color-radar-500: #f97316; /* Primary */
--color-radar-600: #ea580c; /* Hover */

/* Trend Track - Analysis Purple */
--color-track-500: #a855f7; /* Primary */
--color-track-600: #9333ea; /* Hover */

/* Content Clone - Creative Rose */
--color-clone-500: #e11d48; /* Primary */
--color-clone-600: #be185d; /* Hover */

/* Success Predict - Achievement Amber */
--color-predict-500: #f59e0b; /* Primary */
--color-predict-600: #d97706; /* Hover */

/* Voice Echo - Communication Teal */
--color-echo-500: #0891b2; /* Primary */
--color-echo-600: #0e7490; /* Hover */
```

## 🖼️ DRS TEXTURE INTEGRATION STRATEGY

### Background Compatibility System

```css
/* Light Mode Base */
.bg-texture-light {
  background: var(--color-base-100); /* #f8f9fa */
  background-image: url('/assets/textures/drs-paper-light.webp');
  background-blend-mode: multiply;
  opacity: 0.7;
}

/* Dark Mode Base */
.bg-texture-dark {
  background: var(--color-base-800); /* #262626 */
  background-image: url('/assets/textures/drs-paper-dark.webp');
  background-blend-mode: screen;
  opacity: 0.8;
}

/* Tool-Specific Texture Overlays */
.texture-intel {
  background: linear-gradient(
    135deg, 
    rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.1) 0%, 
    transparent 50%
  ), url('/assets/textures/drs-paper-light.webp');
}

.texture-pulse {
  background: linear-gradient(
    135deg, 
    rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.1) 0%, 
    transparent 50%
  ), url('/assets/textures/drs-paper-light.webp');
}
```

### Premium Texture Implementation

**Layer Structure:**

1. **Base Layer**: DRS texture (subtle paper/canvas)
2. **Colour Overlay**: Tool-specific colour at 10-20% opacity
3. **Gradient Accent**: Directional gradient for depth
4. **Content Layer**: Clean typography and UI elements

**Performance Optimization:**

- WebP format textures (<50KB each)
- CSS background-blend-mode for colour integration
- Lazy loading for texture assets
- Fallback solid colours for slow connections

## 🌓 DARK MODE STRATEGY

### Dark Mode Colour Adjustments

```css
[data-theme="dark"] {
  /* Inverted Grayscale */
  --color-base-50: #0a0a0a;
  --color-base-100: #171717;
  --color-base-200: #262626;
  --color-base-800: #e5e5e5;
  --color-base-900: #f8f9fa;
  
  /* Tool Colours - Slightly Desaturated for Dark */
  --color-intel-500: #60a5fa; /* Lighter blue */
  --color-pulse-500: #4ade80; /* Lighter green */
  --color-radar-500: #fb923c; /* Lighter orange */
  --color-predict-500: #fbbf24; /* Lighter gold */
  --color-echo-500: #2dd4bf; /* Lighter teal */
}
```

### DRS Texture Dark Mode Adaptation

- **Invert texture brightness** for dark backgrounds
- **Increase colour overlay opacity** (15-25%) for better visibility
- **Adjust blend modes** (screen/overlay vs multiply)
- **Maintain brand colour recognition** across light/dark

## 📱 IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

### CSS Custom Properties Setup

```css
/* Texture System */
:root {
  --texture-paper: url('/assets/textures/drs-paper-light.webp');
  --texture-canvas: url('/assets/textures/drs-canvas-light.webp');
  --texture-noise: url('/assets/textures/drs-noise-light.webp');
  
  --blend-mode: multiply;
  --overlay-opacity: 0.1;
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  --texture-paper: url('/assets/textures/drs-paper-dark.webp');
  --texture-canvas: url('/assets/textures/drs-canvas-dark.webp');
  --texture-noise: url('/assets/textures/drs-noise-dark.webp');
  
  --blend-mode: screen;
  --overlay-opacity: 0.15;
}
```

### Component Usage Examples

```css
/* Command Center Card */
.command-card {
  background: var(--color-command-50);
  background-image: var(--texture-paper);
  background-blend-mode: var(--blend-mode);
  border: 1px solid rgba(100, 116, 139, 0.2);
}

/* Audio Intel Active State */
.intel-active {
  background: linear-gradient(
    135deg,
    rgba(59, 130, 246, var(--overlay-opacity)) 0%,
    transparent 50%
  ), var(--texture-paper);
}
```

## CSV Alternative Skip Notion API Integration

_Source: 📝 CONTENT & BRAND 2660a35b21ed8162baeaf8afbf100b2e/CSV Alternative Skip Notion API Integration 26f0a35b21ed81d18da7dc479c323543.md_

# CSV Alternative: Skip Notion API Integration

## **The Problem with Notion Integrations**

Notion's integration system is notoriously frustrating. The secret keys often don't appear correctly, workspace permissions get confused, and it takes forever to set up properly.

## **Simple CSV Alternative**

Instead of fighting with Notion API, let's create a system where:

1. You manage content in Notion (which you can do easily)
2. Export to CSV when ready to post
3. Cursor automation reads from CSV files
4. Much simpler, more reliable, easier to debug

## **How It Works**

### **Step 1: Export Your Ready Content**

From your Social Media Content database:

1. Create a view filtered by "Status = Ready to Post"
2. Export as CSV
3. Save to a folder like `/social-automation/content/ready-posts.csv`

### **Step 2: CSV Structure**

```
title,content,platform,contentType,scheduledTime,utmTracking
"94% Automation Thread","Right, so this whole music marketing...","Twitter/X|LinkedIn|Threads","Thread","2025-09-16 09:00","?utm_source=social&utm_campaign=beta"
"Personal Story","Right, so I've been coding at 2am...","LinkedIn","LinkedIn Post","2025-09-18 09:00","?utm_source=social&utm_campaign=beta"
```

### **Step 3: Cursor Automation Script**

```tsx
// social-automation.ts
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';

interface SocialPost {
  title: string;
  content: string;
  platform: string[];  // Split by |
  contentType: string;
  scheduledTime: string;
  utmTracking: string;
}

function loadPostsFromCSV(): SocialPost[] {
  const csvPath = './content/ready-posts.csv';
  const csvContent = fs.readFileSync(csvPath, 'utf8');
  
  // Parse CSV and return structured posts
  // Implementation details...
}

function processContentForUK(content: string): string {
  // UK spelling conversion
  content = content.replace(/realize/g, 'realise');
  content = content.replace(/organize/g, 'organise');
  // Remove emojis
  content = content.replace(/[\u{1f300}-\u{1f5ff}\u{1f900}-\u{1f9ff}\u{1f600}-\u{1f64f}\u{1f680}-\u{1f6ff}\u{2600}-\u{26ff}\u{2700}-\u{27bf}]/gu, '');
  return content;
}

function shouldPostNow(scheduledTime: string): boolean {
  const now = new Date();
  const scheduled = new Date(scheduledTime);
  
  // Check if within 15 minutes of scheduled time
  const diff = Math.abs(now.getTime() - scheduled.getTime());
  return diff < 15 * 60 * 1000; // 15 minutes
}

function updatePostStatus(title: string, status: 'posted' | 'failed') {
  // Update a separate status CSV or log file
  const statusLog = `${new Date().toISOString()},${title},${status}\n`;
  fs.appendFileSync('./logs/post-status.csv', statusLog);
}
```

### **Step 4: Platform Posting Functions**

```tsx
// platforms/twitter.ts
export async function postToTwitter(content: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // Twitter API v2 implementation
  // Return true if successful
}

// platforms/linkedin.ts
export async function postToLinkedIn(content: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // LinkedIn API implementation
  // Return true if successful
}

// platforms/bluesky.ts
export async function postToBluesky(content: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // Blue Sky AT Protocol implementation
  // Return true if successful
}
```

### **Step 5: Main Automation Loop**

```tsx
// main.ts
import { loadPostsFromCSV, processContentForUK, shouldPostNow } from './content-manager';
import { postToTwitter } from './platforms/twitter';
import { postToLinkedIn } from './platforms/linkedin';
import { postToBluesky } from './platforms/bluesky';

async function runAutomation() {
  const posts = loadPostsFromCSV();
  
  for (const post of posts) {
    if (shouldPostNow(post.scheduledTime)) {
      const processedContent = processContentForUK(post.content);
      
      // Add UTM tracking to links
      const finalContent = processedContent.replace(
        /intel\.totalaudiopromo\.com/g,
        `[intel.totalaudiopromo.com](http://intel.totalaudiopromo.com)${post.utmTracking}`
      );
      
      // Post to each platform
      for (const platform of post.platform) {
        try {
          let success = false;
          
          switch (platform) {
            case 'Twitter/X':
              success = await postToTwitter(finalContent);
              break;
            case 'LinkedIn':
              success = await postToLinkedIn(finalContent);
              break;
            case 'Blue Sky':
              success = await postToBluesky(finalContent);
              break;
          }
          
          if (success) {
            updatePostStatus(`${post.title} - ${platform}`, 'posted');
          } else {
            updatePostStatus(`${post.title} - ${platform}`, 'failed');
          }
        } catch (error) {
          console.error(`Failed to post to ${platform}:`, error);
          updatePostStatus(`${post.title} - ${platform}`, 'failed');
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

// Run every 15 minutes
setInterval(runAutomation, 15 * 60 * 1000);
```

## **Advantages of This Approach**

1. **No Notion API Headaches**: You manage content in Notion, export when ready
2. **Simple Debugging**: CSV files are easy to read and modify
3. **Version Control**: CSV files can be committed to git
4. **Reliable**: No API token issues or integration failures
5. **Fast Development**: Cursor can build this quickly
6. **Easy Updates**: Just re-export CSV when content changes

## **Your Current Content Ready to Export**

Your database has these posts ready:

- **94% Automation Thread** (Twitter/LinkedIn/Threads)
- **Building Audio Intel Story** (LinkedIn)
- **Radio Submission Tips** (Twitter/Blue Sky)
- **vs Groover/SubmitHub** (LinkedIn/Twitter)

## **Weekly Workflow**

1. **Sunday**: Plan week's content in Notion
2. **Monday**: Export "Ready to Post" view as CSV
3. **Automation**: Runs every 15 minutes, posts at scheduled times
4. **Friday**: Check status logs, plan next week

## **File Structure**

```
social-automation/
├── content/
│   ├── ready-posts.csv
│   └── templates/
├── logs/
│   ├── post-status.csv
│   └── errors.log
├── platforms/
│   ├── twitter.ts
│   ├── linkedin.ts
│   └── bluesky.ts
└── main.ts
```

This sidesteps all the Notion integration problems and gets you automated posting much faster. Want to try this approach instead?

# How to Get Better News (Stop Getting Trump Stories!)

**Problem:** Your newsjacker is pulling too much US political news and Trump stories.

**Solution:** Change 2 simple settings to get news that matches your niche.

---

## 📍 Where to Make Changes

1. **Open your n8n workflow** (Newsjacker 3000)
2. **Click on the "news api" node**
3. **Look for the "Query Parameters" section**

---

## 🛠️ Step 1: Fix the Page Size

**Find the parameter:** `pagesize`

**Change the name to:** `pageSize` (capital S)

**Keep the value:** `15`

---

## 🌍 Step 2: Change Your Country

**Find the parameter:** `country`

**Current value:** `us` (this gives you lots of Trump news)

**Change to one of these:**

- `gb` ← United Kingdom (English, less US politics)
- `de` ← Germany
- `ca` ← Canada (English, less Trump focus)
- `au` ← Australia
- `fr` ← France
- `nl` ← Netherlands

**Or:**

- **Delete this parameter entirely** ← Gets you global/world news from all countries
- Keep `us` if you specifically want US news

**Pro tip:** Deleting the country parameter completely gives you the most diverse, international news coverage!

---

## 📂 Step 3: Add a Category Filter

**Click "Add Parameter"**

**Name:** `category`

**Value:** Pick one:

- `business` ← Perfect for startups/entrepreneurs
- `technology` ← Great for AI/automation content
- `science` ← Tech innovation stories
- `health` ← Wellness/longevity content
- `entertainment` ← Pop culture stories
- `sports` ← Sports news
- `general` ← Mixed content

---

## ✅ Recommended Setups

### **For European Startup Content:**

```
country: gb
category: business
pageSize: 15

```

### **For Global Tech/AI News:**

```
country: us
category: technology
pageSize: 15

```

### **For International Business:**

```
country: ca
category: business
pageSize: 15

```

### **For General Non-Political News:**

```
country: au
category: general
pageSize: 15

```

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Make your changes**
2. **Click "Test step"** at the bottom
3. **Check the output** - you should see more relevant stories
4. **Adjust if needed** and test again

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Keep the `from` parameter** - this ensures you only get news from the last 24 hours
- **You can mix country + category** - this works perfectly
- **Start simple** - just change the country first, then add category
- **Test after each change** to see what works best for your niche

---

## 💡 Quick Wins

**Getting too much Trump news?** → Change country from `us` to `gb`

**Want startup content?** → Add category: `business`

**Want tech content?** → Add category: `technology`

**Want less political news?** → Use any country except `us`

---

**Result:** You'll get fresh, relevant news from the last 24 hours that actually fits your content niche!

## Fix Cursor + Notion Integration Setup

_Source: 📝 CONTENT & BRAND 2660a35b21ed8162baeaf8afbf100b2e/Fix Cursor + Notion Integration Setup 26f0a35b21ed814b8546f58ad3701ba0.md_

# Fix: Cursor + Notion Integration Setup

# Cursor + Notion Integration Setup

## **Current Problem**

Cursor can't access your Notion workspace because you're using the hosted MCP server that only works with Claude. Cursor needs direct API access.

## **Solution: Notion API Integration for Cursor**

### **Step 1: Get Your Notion Integration Token**

1. Go to [https://www.notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Create new integration called "Total Audio Social Automation"
3. Copy the "Internal Integration Token" (starts with `secret_`)
4. **Capabilities needed**: Read content, Update content, Insert content

### **Step 2: Share Database with Integration**

1. Go to your Social Media Content database: [Social Media Content - User Acquisition](Social%20Media%20Content%20-%20User%20Acquisition%2075c7e9291f49412ca546b4e880291455.md)
2. Click "Share" → "Add people, emails, groups, or integrations"
3. Add your "Total Audio Social Automation" integration
4. Give it "Full access"

### **Step 3: Update Your MCP Configuration**

Replace your current MCP config with this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notion": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-notion"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NOTION_API_KEY": "secret_YOUR_INTEGRATION_TOKEN_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Step 4: Environment Variables for Cursor Script**

Create `.env` file in your project:

```
# Notion Integration
NOTION_API_KEY=secret_YOUR_INTEGRATION_TOKEN_HERE
NOTION_DATABASE_ID=7002006e-000f-42ff-a414-6130df40d8d7

# Social Media APIs (to be added)
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=your_twitter_token
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=your_linkedin_id
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=your_linkedin_secret
BLUESKY_USERNAME=your_bluesky_username
BLUESKY_PASSWORD=your_bluesky_password
```

### **Step 5: Notion API Package for TypeScript**

Cursor will need to install:

```bash
npm install @notionhq/client
npm install @types/node
```

### **Step 6: Basic Connection Test**

Create this test file for Cursor to verify connection:

```tsx
// test-notion-connection.ts
import { Client } from '@notionhq/client';

const notion = new Client({
  auth: process.env.NOTION_API_KEY,
});

async function testConnection() {
  try {
    // Test database access
    const response = await notion.databases.query({
      database_id: process.env.NOTION_DATABASE_ID || '',
      filter: {
        property: 'Status',
        select: {
          equals: 'Ready to Post'
        }
      }
    });
    
    console.log('✅ Notion connection successful!');
    console.log(`Found ${response.results.length} posts ready to post`);
    
    // Show sample post
    if (response.results.length > 0) {
      const post = response.results[0] as any;
      console.log('Sample post:', {
        title: [post.properties](http://post.properties).Title?.title[0]?.text?.content || 'No title',
        platforms: [post.properties](http://post.properties).Platform?.multi_select?.map((p: any) => [p.name](http://p.name)) || [],
        content: [post.properties](http://post.properties).Content?.rich_text[0]?.text?.content?.substring(0, 100) + '...' || 'No content'
      });
    }
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ Notion connection failed:', error);
  }
}

testConnection();
```
