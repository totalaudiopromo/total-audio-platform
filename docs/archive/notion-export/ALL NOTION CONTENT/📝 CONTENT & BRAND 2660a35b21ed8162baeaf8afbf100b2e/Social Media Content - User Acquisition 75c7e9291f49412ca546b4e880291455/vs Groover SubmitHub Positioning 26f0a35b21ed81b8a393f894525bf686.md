# vs Groover/SubmitHub Positioning

Content: Stop paying €3-15 per submission. Get verified contacts directly.

❌ Groover: €29/month for submissions → gatekeepers decide
❌ SubmitHub: $3+ per pitch → no guarantee of quality
❌ Playlist Push: £149+ campaigns → expensive for indie budgets

✅ Audio Intel: £19.99/month → verified contact intelligence you own forever

What Spotify for Artists doesn't tell you: who to actually pitch to.

Skip the submission gatekeepers, go direct to decision makers.

Contact intelligence that pays for itself in one successful pitch.

Building this for the independent artist I was 5 years ago - talented, driven, but completely lost in the promotion maze.

Tested with real UK radio promotion campaigns. Currently in beta.

Would appreciate feedback from anyone tired of paying per submission: http://intel.totalaudiopromo.com
