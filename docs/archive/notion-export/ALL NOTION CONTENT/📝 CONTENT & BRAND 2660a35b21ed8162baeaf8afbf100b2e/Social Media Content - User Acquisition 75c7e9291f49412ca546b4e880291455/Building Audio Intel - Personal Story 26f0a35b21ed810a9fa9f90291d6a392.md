# Building Audio Intel - Personal Story

Content: Right, so I've been coding at 2am whilst the girlfriend and kids sleep...

After 5+ years in radio promotion (including BBC Radio 1 pitches), I got properly fed up with the manual contact research. Spreadsheets everywhere, outdated databases, 15+ hours weekly just finding the right people to pitch to.

So I built Audio Intel.

Not another generic music tool - this is contact intelligence specifically for the UK music industry. Transforms chaotic contact spreadsheets into organised databases in about 2 minutes.

£19.99/month vs the £200-500+ US alternatives.

Built by someone who actually uses it daily for sadact releases and client campaigns.

Beta testing now - if you're spending too much time on contact research, would appreciate your thoughts: http://intel.totalaudiopromo.com
