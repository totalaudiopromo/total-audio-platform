Building Audio Intel - Personal Story,,,,"Right, so I've been coding at 2am whilst the girlfriend and kids sleep...

After 5+ years in radio promotion (including BBC Radio 1 pitches), I got properly fed up with the manual contact research. Spreadsheets everywhere, outdated databases, 15+ hours weekly just finding the right people to pitch to.

So I built Audio Intel.

Not another generic music tool - this is contact intelligence specifically for the UK music industry. Transforms chaotic contact spreadsheets into organised databases in about 2 minutes.

£19.99/month vs the £200-500+ US alternatives.

Built by someone who actually uses it daily for sadact releases and client campaigns.

Beta testing now - if you're spending too much time on contact research, would appreciate your thoughts: http://intel.totalaudiopromo.com

94% Automation Thread - Opening Week,,,,"Right, so this whole music marketing automation thing...
94% of what we do is basically admin work that could be sorted automatically

1/ Contact list building - currently eating 15+ hours a week of my life
Manual research is killing any chance of actually making music tbh

✅ Use AI contact discovery tools
✅ Set automated database updates  
✅ Import from verified industry sources

Stop building lists. Start building relationships mate

2/ Email personalisation takes ages for scale tho
Generic pitches get about 2% response rates (brutal)

✅ Use AI to customise subject lines
✅ Automate personal detail insertion
✅ Create template variations by genre

Personalisation at scale beats mass generic outreach

3/ Social media posting eats daily creative time
Inconsistent posting kills algorithmic reach

✅ Schedule content across all platforms
✅ Auto-resize posts for each network
✅ Set up cross-platform syndication

Consistency builds audiences. Automation enables consistency

Why 94% of music marketing tasks can be automated:
• Contact discovery
• Email personalisation
• Social media management
• Analytics tracking
• Timeline coordination
• Relationship management

Focus on music. Let technology handle the rest mate

Radio Submission Windows - Industry Tip,,,,"Radio submission windows close faster than you think

Most stations plan 6-8 weeks ahead for new music
Submit 2 months before target airplay date
Research their typical lead times first
Include multiple format options (clean/explicit)

Early submission beats perfect timing every time

vs Groover/SubmitHub Positioning,,,,"Stop paying €3-15 per submission. Get verified contacts directly.

❌ Groover: €29/month for submissions → gatekeepers decide
❌ SubmitHub: $3+ per pitch → no guarantee of quality
❌ Playlist Push: £149+ campaigns → expensive for indie budgets

✅ Audio Intel: £19.99/month → verified contact intelligence you own forever

What Spotify for Artists doesn't tell you: who to actually pitch to.

Skip the submission gatekeepers, go direct to decision makers.

Contact intelligence that pays for itself in one successful pitch.

Building this for the independent artist I was 5 years ago - talented, driven, but completely lost in the promotion maze.

Tested with real UK radio promotion campaigns. Currently in beta.
