# Gmail Label Colour Setup - Manual Instructions

Your Gmail labels are created and working. Here's the quick manual setup to add colours:

## 1. Open Gmail Settings
1. Go to [Gmail](https://mail.google.com)
2. Click the gear icon (⚙️) in top right
3. Click "See all settings"
4. Click the "Labels" tab

## 2. Set Label Colours

Find each label in the list and click the colour square next to it:

### **Active Campaigns** → 🟢 **Green**
- Represents current radio work that needs attention

### **Needs Action** → 🔵 **Blue**
- Campaigns requiring your immediate response

### **Station Feedback** → 🟠 **Orange**
- Real responses from radio stations (important)

### **Station Auto-Responses** → ⚪ **Grey**
- Out of office replies (low priority)

### **Completed** → 🟡 **Yellow**
- Finished campaigns from last 30 days

### **Old Campaigns** → 🔴 **Red**
- Archive for reference

### **Agent** → 🟣 **Purple**
- Processed by your radio promo agent

## 3. Save Changes
Click "Save Changes" at the bottom of the page.

## 4. Optional: Hide Low Priority Labels
To reduce clutter, you can:
- Set "Station Auto-Responses" to "Hide" in message list
- This keeps auto-replies organised but out of your main view

## Quick Visual Reference
```
🟢 Active Campaigns    - Your current work
🔵 Needs Action       - Requires response
🟠 Station Feedback   - Station responses
⚪ Station Auto-Responses - Auto-replies
🟡 Completed         - Recent wins
🔴 Old Campaigns     - Archive
🟣 Agent            - Automated processing
```

This should take about 2-3 minutes to complete. Your Gmail will then have a clear visual system for radio promotion workflow.

## Verification
After setup, your Gmail sidebar will show coloured labels making it easy to:
- Spot urgent work (blue)
- See active campaigns (green)
- Notice station responses (orange)
- Ignore auto-replies (grey/hidden)
