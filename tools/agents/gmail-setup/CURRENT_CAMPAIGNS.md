## How It Works

### Automatic Routing (11 filters active)

**Current Campaigns:**

- Kiara/Bloodshot emails →  Kiara - Bloodshot
- Senior Dunce/Bestial emails →  Senior Dunce - Bestial
- Weekly releases from Sam →  Weekly Releases (always in inbox)

**Station Feedback:**

- Mentions "Chris" → Keep in inbox + mark important
- Doesn't mention "Chris" → Archive to Liberty/Station Feedback

**Personal Tools:**

- Otter AI → Archive to Personal/Otter AI
- Gemini → Archive to Personal/Gemini

**Marketing Junk:**

- WARM/Machina/Music Reaction → Archive + mark read

### Inbox Behavior

**STAYS IN INBOX:**

-  Kiara - Bloodshot (if mentions "Chris")
-  Senior Dunce - Bestial (if mentions "Chris")
-  Weekly Releases (always)
- Liberty/Station Feedback (if mentions "Chris")
- Liberty/Internal (team emails)

**ARCHIVED AUTOMATICALLY:**

- Campaign emails without "Chris"
- Station feedback without "Chris"
- Otter AI transcripts
- Gemini transcripts
- All marketing spam
- Auto-responses

## Adding New Campaigns

When you start a new campaign, tell me:

1. Campaign name (artist + release)
2. Keywords to watch for

I'll:

1. Create emoji label (colored)
2. Add filter to auto-route emails
3. Move existing emails to the label
4. Archive old campaign to Liberty/Archive

## Label Colors

-  **Red**- Kiara Bloodshot
