Meeting Transcript - Radio Campaign Planning Session
Date: September 6, 2025
Participants: Chris Schofield, Marketing Team

Chris: Alright everyone, let's plan the radio campaign for our next release. 

Marketing: What's the artist name and track details?

Chris: The artist is Sarah Thompson and the track title is "Electric Dreams". It's an electronic pop genre track with some indie influences.

Marketing: When's the release date?

Chris: We're looking at October 15th, 2025 for the release date. That gives us about 6 weeks to prepare.

Chris: The budget for this campaign is around $5,000 for radio promotion. We want to target college radio stations primarily, but also some commercial stations that play electronic music.

Marketing: What's the priority level for this campaign?

Chris: This is high priority. Sarah's been building a really strong following and this could be her breakthrough track. The deadline for getting everything set up is September 30th.

Chris: We need to focus our targets on stations that play electronic, indie pop, and alternative music. College radio will probably be our sweet spot for this genre.

Marketing: Got it, so we're looking at electronic genre, targeting college and alternative radio, high priority campaign with October release.

Chris: Exactly. Let's make sure we track everything carefully and hit those milestone numbers for Sarah.
