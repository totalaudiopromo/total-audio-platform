## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Can't find enough emails"

→ LinkedIn: Message directly for email

### "Low open rates"
→ Use Template 1 subject line: "How I researched BBC Radio 1 contacts in 15 minutes"
→ Send Tuesday-Thursday 9-11am (best open times)
→ Avoid weekends

### "No demo bookings"
→ Re-read Template 1 (85% conversion proven)
→ Check personalisation (first name, company name)
→ Add LinkedIn verification step (they need to be REAL promoters)

### "Not sure if it's working"
→ Test with 10 emails first
→ Track: opens, clicks, replies
→ Optimize before scaling to 50
