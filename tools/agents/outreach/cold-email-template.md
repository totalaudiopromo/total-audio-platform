## Template 1: The BBC Radio 1 Story (Best Performer)

**Subject:** How I researched BBC Radio 1 contacts in 15 minutes

Hi {{firstName}},

I'm Chris – I run sadact (electronic music project) and I've been doing radio promotion for 5+ years.

Last month I was pitching to BBC Radio 1. Usually contact research takes me 15+ hours per campaign. This time I built a tool that did it in 15 minutes.

The tool is called Audio Intel. It turned my chaotic spreadsheet into an organised database of BBC contacts – including Clara Amfo, Annie Mac's team, and Jack Saunders.

100% success rate. Every contact validated and enriched.

I'm now offering it to other promoters at £19/month (saves ~12 hours per campaign).

**Free demo:** Upload 5 of your contacts, watch it work in real-time.

Interested?

## Template 2: Time Savings Focus

**Subject:** 15 hours → 15 minutes (radio contact research)

Hi {{firstName}},

Quick question – how long do you spend researching radio contacts per campaign?

For me it was 15+ hours. BBC Radio 1, Spotify editorial, Radio X producers... all manual spreadsheet chaos.

I built Audio Intel to fix this. It:
• Enriches contact data automatically
• Organises messy spreadsheets into databases
• Validates emails, phone numbers, socials
• Works on mobile (actually usable on the go)

Real results: BBC Radio 1 pitch went from 15 hours research → 15 minutes.

£19/month. First 10 enrichments free.

**Demo:** intel.totalaudiopromo.com

Worth 15 minutes to save 15 hours?

## Template 3: Industry Credibility

**Subject:** Built by someone who actually does radio promotion

Hi {{firstName}},

Most contact tools are built by Silicon Valley people who've never pitched to BBC Radio 1.

Audio Intel is different – I built it because I needed it.

Background:
• 5+ years radio promotion (BBC Radio 1, Spotify, Radio X)
• sadact producer (electronic music)
• Pitched to Clara Amfo, Jack Saunders, Annie Mac's team
• Tired of spending weekends in Excel hell

Audio Intel saves 12-15 hours per campaign. Real case study: BBC Radio 1 contact research went from 15 hours → 15 minutes.

£19/month. Free demo with your actual contacts.

**Try it:** intel.totalaudiopromo.com

Does this solve a real problem for you?

## Template 4: Mutual Pain Point

Hi {{firstName}},

Do you spend your weekends researching radio contacts?

I did. Every campaign = 15+ hours of:

• Checking socials
• Organising chaotic spreadsheets

Then I built Audio Intel to automate it.

Results:
✅ BBC Radio 1: 15 hours → 15 minutes
✅ 100% contact enrichment success rate
✅ Works on mobile (not just desktop)
✅ £19/month (saves 12+ hours per campaign)
