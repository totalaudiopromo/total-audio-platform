## MESSAGE TEMPLATES

### Template 1 - PR Industry Contacts

**Subject:** Quick favor - testing something that could help you

Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well! I've been working on something that might be useful for PR work - an AI tool that instantly enriches contact lists with hard-to-find details (social handles, recent coverage, contact preferences).

Since we've worked together before, I'd love your quick thoughts. Would you be interested in trying the beta? Takes 2 minutes to test with your own contacts.

No pressure at all - just thought you might find it useful!

Best,
Chris

### Template 2 - Artist/Label Contacts

**Subject:** Built something for music industry contacts

Hi [Name],

I've been developing an AI tool specifically for music industry contact research - it finds social handles, recent coverage, and contact preferences that are usually buried deep in Google searches.

Given our past work together, I thought you might find it interesting. Would you be up for giving the beta a quick try?

[Beta link: intel.totalaudiopromo.com/beta]

Always happy to chat about how it could help with your projects.

Cheers,
Chris
