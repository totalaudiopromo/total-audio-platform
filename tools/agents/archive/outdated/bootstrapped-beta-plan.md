  ```
  "Hey [Name], you know how we spend hours digging through websites
  and social media to research contacts before pitching?

  I built Audio Intel to solve that exact problem - it turns basic email
  lists into detailed contact intelligence with submission guidelines,
  contact preferences, and pitch tips.

  Want to be one of my beta testers? It's completely free and could
  save you those painful 3-hour research sessions."
  ```

#### **Independent Artists You Know**

- **Goal**: 15-20 beta signups from artists
- **Approach**: Direct message on socials or text

  ```
  "Hey [Name], tired of spending forever researching who to pitch your music to?

  I built Audio Intel - it takes basic contact lists and enriches them with
  everything you need: submission guidelines, contact preferences, coverage areas.

  No more guessing what playlist curators or radio DJs are looking for.
  Want to try it free during beta?"
  ```

#### **Radio Station Contacts**

- **Goal**: 5-10 beta signups from radio professionals
- **Approach**: Direct outreach to people you know
- **Message Template**:

  ```
  "Hey [Name], I built something that could help people pitch to you better.

  Audio Intel turns basic contact lists into detailed intelligence - so instead
  of getting generic pitches, people would know your submission preferences,
  coverage areas, and what you're actually looking for.

  Since you're on the receiving end of pitches, your feedback would be gold.
  Want to check it out?"
