## 🎯 **Quick Reference Scripts**

### **PR/Marketing Contacts**:

```
"Hey [Name], you know those painful 3-hour research sessions
digging through websites for submission guidelines?

I built Audio Intel to solve that - it enriches basic email
lists with submission guidelines, contact preferences, and
pitch tips.

Want to beta test it? Could save you those research nightmares."
```

### **Artists/Musicians**:

```
"Hey [Name], how much time do you spend researching who to
pitch your music to?

I built Audio Intel to stop the guesswork - it turns contact
lists into detailed intelligence about what curators and
DJs actually want.

Want to try it free during beta?"
```

### **Radio/Media**:

```
"Hey [Name], I built something that could help people pitch
to you better - they'd actually know your submission
preferences instead of sending generic stuff.

Since you get tons of pitches, your feedback would be gold.
Want to check it out?"
```
