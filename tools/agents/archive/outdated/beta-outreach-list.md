## 🎯 **Quick Reference Scripts**

### **PR/Marketing Contacts**:
```
"Hey [Name], you know those painful 3-hour research sessions 
digging through websites for submission guidelines? 

I built Audio Intel to solve that - it enriches basic email 
lists with submission guidelines, contact preferences, and 
pitch tips.

Want to beta test it? Could save you those research nightmares."
```

### **Artists/Musicians**:
```
"Hey [Name], how much time do you spend researching who to 
pitch your music to?

I built Audio Intel to stop the guesswork - it turns contact 
lists into detailed intelligence about what curators and 
DJs actually want.

Want to try it free during beta?"
```

### **Radio/Media**:
```
"Hey [Name], I built something that could help people pitch 
to you better - they'd actually know your submission 
preferences instead of sending generic stuff.

Since you get tons of pitches, your feedback would be gold. 
Want to check it out?"
```
