# TOTAL AUDIO AGENT SDK UPGRADE - AUDIT SUMMARY

**Date**: 2 October 2025
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Implementation

---

## PHASE 1 COMPLETE: COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT

### What We've Done

1. **Agent Discovery & Inventory**(`agent-inventory.md`)
   - Catalogued 40+ JavaScript agents across Total Audio ecosystem
   - Identified current SDK usage (only 4 agents using SDK)
   - Categorized by function and priority
   - Documented all file locations and purposes

2. **SDK Usage Analysis**(`upgrade-priorities.md`)
   - Analyzed current implementation patterns
   - Identified missing features (streaming, caching, agentic loops)
   - Classified upgrade priorities ( Critical,  High,  Medium,  Low)
   - Created detailed upgrade roadmap

3. **Cost & Performance Analysis**(`cost-analysis.md`)
   - Estimated current monthly costs: £37.60
   - Projected costs after upgrade: £17.92 (52% reduction)
   - Calculated ROI: 105-173% over 3 years
   - Break-even: 5-8 months (realistic scenario)
   - Identified non-financial benefits (productivity, reliability, scalability)

4. **Base Classes Implementation**
   - Created `StreamingAgent` base class (`src/agents/base/StreamingAgent.ts`)
   - Created `CachedContextManager` (`src/agents/context/CachedContextManager.ts`)
   - Created `BatchContactProcessor` (`src/agents/batch/BatchContactProcessor.ts`)
   - All with comprehensive TypeScript types and event emitters
