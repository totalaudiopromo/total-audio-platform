Hi Anika,

Quick follow-up on KYARA's "Bloodshot" - it officially dropped Monday and I wanted to make sure it landed on your radar.

Since reaching out last week, the track has picked up:
- Amazing Radio support (UK)
- 85 plays across 9 countries pre-release
- Strong streaming momentum in first 48 hours

Given you played "Yearn" on Home & Hosed back in August, I thought you'd want to know the follow-up is resonating well.

Would love to get your thoughts when you have a moment.

## Template 2: Music Director Follow-Up (Claire Mooney - Triple J)

**Subject:** KYARA "Bloodshot" update - Amazing Radio + 85 plays

**Body:**

```
Hi Claire,

Following up on KYARA's "Bloodshot" - wanted to share some quick momentum updates since I last reached out.

The track's first week has been strong:
 Amazing Radio (UK) confirmed support
 85 plays across 9 countries
 Home & Hosed history (Jaimee played "Yearn" in August)
 All self-produced in Sydney bedroom studio

Listen: [SPOTIFY LINK]

I think this demonstrates the track's got legs beyond Triple J's existing support. Worth consideration for broader rotation?

Happy to send over any additional info you need.

Cheers,
