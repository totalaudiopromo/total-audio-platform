## DEMO SCRIPT FOR DAN

### Opening (1 minute):

"Right, so this is the KYARA 'Bloodshot' campaign I'm running through Liberty right now. Release is Monday. Let me show you how I'm tracking everything in one place..."

### Dashboard Walkthrough (3 minutes):

**1. Campaign Card:**
"Here's the overview - KYARA, 'Bloodshot', releasing Monday. You can see at a glance: 15 contacts pitched, 85 plays already, 3 confirmed adds including Amazing Radio."

**2. Activity Timeline:**
"This timeline shows everything that's happened. Week 1, I sent the pre-release pitch to 15 Australian contacts. Week 2, I'm doing follow-ups. The tool logged every email sent, every response received."

**3. Integration Status:**
"Here's where it gets interesting. The Gmail integration auto-created 5 drafts in the Liberty inbox. Mailchimp synced the UK contact list. WARM API is pulling real-time play data - that's how I know we're at 85 plays across 9 countries."

**4. Performance Metrics:**
"Email performance: 60% open rate, 26% click rate, 13% response rate. That's actually really good for radio promo. And the WARM data shows we're getting traction - 85 plays before the track even officially drops."

**5. Next Actions:**
"The tool suggests what I should do next. Follow up with Anika at Triple J - she's warm, she played the last single. Thank Amazing Radio. Prep the Monday release blast."

### The Hook (2 minutes):

"Dan, imagine if every Liberty campaign had this level of tracking. You'd know exactly where every campaign stands at any moment. No more digging through emails or spreadsheets. Just open the dashboard."

**The Value Prop:**

- **Save time:** 10+ hours per campaign on admin/tracking
- **Better reporting:** Real-time data for clients
- **Integration:** Gmail, Mailchimp, WARM, Google Sheets all synced
- **AI insights:** Automated next actions and suggestions
- **Multi-campaign view:** See all 20+ Liberty campaigns at once

### The Ask (1 minute):

"I want to pilot this with 3-5 Liberty campaigns this month. Real campaigns, real data. Let's measure the time savings and see if it actually makes your life easier. If it works, we can talk about rolling it out across the whole agency."

## BUSINESS CASE FOR DAN

### Liberty Music PR's Current Pain Points:

1. **20+ campaigns running simultaneously**
   - Hard to track status of each campaign at a glance
   - Spreadsheets everywhere, no single source of truth

2. **Manual email tracking**
   - Gmail inbox chaos (sent, drafts, responses mixed together)
   - No easy way to see who responded, who needs follow-up

3. **Client reporting overhead**
   - Manually compiling stats from WARM, Mailchimp, Gmail
   - Takes 2-3 hours per client report

4. **Integration gaps**
   - WARM data in one place, emails in another, Mailchimp separate
   - No unified view of campaign performance

### What Tracker Solves:

**For Campaign Managers (Dan, Team):**

- See all campaigns in one dashboard
- Track email opens, clicks, responses automatically
- WARM play data synced in real-time
- AI-powered next action suggestions

**For Client Reporting:**

- Auto-generate weekly/monthly reports
- Pull stats directly from integrations (no manual work)
- Export professional PDFs with charts and insights

**For Business Intelligence:**

- Which contact types respond best? (data-driven)
- What email subject lines work? (A/B testing built in)
- Campaign performance benchmarks (compare across artists)

### ROI for Liberty:

**Time Savings:**

- 10 hours/campaign on admin/tracking
- 2-3 hours/client report (auto-generated)
- 5 hours/week on team coordination (everyone sees same dashboard)

**Total Savings Per Month:**

- 20 campaigns × 10 hours = 200 hours saved
- 20 client reports × 2 hours = 40 hours saved
- Team coordination: 20 hours saved
- **Total: 260 hours/month = £3,900/month** (at £15/hour)

**Cost:**

- Pilot: FREE (3-5 campaigns, 4 weeks)
- Agency Plan: £79/month (unlimited campaigns)
- **ROI: 49:1** (£3,900 saved vs £79 cost)

## KILLER DEMO MOMENTS

### Moment 1: Real-Time WARM Data

"See this? 85 plays. That's pulled directly from WARM API in real-time. I didn't manually enter that - the tool fetched it automatically."

### Moment 2: Gmail Integration

"These 5 drafts? The tool created them in the Liberty Gmail inbox using the campaign data. I just reviewed and sent. Saved me 2 hours of manual draft writing."

### Moment 3: Next Actions AI

"This bit here - the tool is telling me what to do next. Follow up with Anika (she's warm), thank Amazing Radio, prep Monday blast. It's like having a campaign manager assistant."

### Moment 4: Multi-Campaign View

"Now imagine this dashboard with all 20 Liberty campaigns. At a glance, you know: which campaigns need attention, which are performing well, where to focus your time."

---

## POTENTIAL OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

### "We already track campaigns in Monday.com"

"Perfect - this can integrate with Monday.com too. Import your boards, sync data both ways. It's not about replacing what works, it's about adding the radio-specific tracking (WARM, email performance) that Monday.com doesn't do."

### "Seems like a lot to learn"

"Fair. That's why I want to pilot it with you first. I'll do the setup, train your team, handle any issues. You just use it for 4 weeks and tell me if it saves you time."

### "What if we need custom features?"

"That's exactly why I'm demoing with you. Tell me what Liberty needs, and I can build it. This campaign tracker is just the foundation - I want to build tools that actually solve your specific workflow problems."

### "How much does it cost?"

"Pilot is free. After that, £79/month for unlimited campaigns and team members. That's less than 6 hours of junior staff time, and it'll save you 200+ hours/month. The math is obvious."
