**TIMING:** Send Thursday evening or Friday morning (before Monday release)

## EMAIL:

Hi Ruby,

Following up on KYARA's "Bloodshot" - wanted to share some crossover momentum that suggests this could work for your audience.

First-week highlights:
- Amazing Radio (UK) support
- 85 plays across 9 countries
- Strong streaming numbers (first 48 hours)
- Triple J credibility (Home & Hosed history with "Yearn")

The production quality is commercial-ready despite being bedroom-produced. Sultry electro-pop with crossover appeal - same emotional depth as "Yearn" but more confident.

Given Jaimee Taylor-Neilsen supported "Yearn" back in August, thought you'd want to hear how this one's tracking before Monday's official release.

**Listen:** [SPOTIFY PRE-SAVE LINK]
**Download WAV:** [WETRANSFER/DROPBOX LINK]

Worth a listen if you're after Sydney talent with proven traction.

Best,
Chris Schofield

**RECOMMENDATION:** Use the main version - it's more substantial but still respectful. Ruby knows KYARA from "Yearn" so this is a warm follow-up, not a cold pitch.
