## EMAIL BODY TEMPLATE

### Template A: WARM CONTACTS (Anika Luna, previous responders)

**Subject:** Quick update - KYARA "Bloodshot" is out today

**Body:**

```
Hi [NAME],

Quick one - KYARA's "Bloodshot" officially dropped today.

Since I sent you the pre-release version, it's picked up some nice momentum:
- Amazing Radio (UK) added it to rotation
- 85 plays across 9 countries pre-release
- Strong first 24 hours on streaming

Listen: [SPOTIFY LINK]
Download WAV: [WETRANSFER LINK]

Given you [played "Yearn" / responded last time / showed interest], I thought you'd want to know it's officially out.

Worth considering for [Triple J / your show]?

Best,
Chris

### Template B: NON-RESPONDERS (Initial pitch, no response)

**Subject:** KYARA "Bloodshot" OUT TODAY - 85 plays, Amazing Radio support

**Body:**

```
Hi [NAME],

Following up - Sydney artist KYARA's "Bloodshot" officially dropped today.

The track's built some solid pre-release momentum:
 Amazing Radio (UK) - confirmed rotation
 85 plays across 9 countries
 Triple J Home & Hosed history (played "Yearn" in August)
 Self-produced in bedroom studio (Sydney)

Listen: [SPOTIFY LINK]
Download: [WETRANSFER LINK]

It's hypnotic electro-pop - sultry beats, ethereal melodies, strong empowerment narrative. Think classic synthpop with a modern edge.

Worth checking out if you're after new [Australian / electronic / independent] artists.

Best,
Chris Schofield

### Template C: NEW CONTACTS (Never pitched before)

**Subject:** KYARA "Bloodshot" - Sydney artist, out today (Amazing Radio + Triple J)

**Body:**

```
Hi [NAME],

I'm Chris from Liberty Music PR - reaching out about Sydney-based artist KYARA.

Her new single "Bloodshot" dropped today, and I think it'd be perfect for [your show / your station].

Quick context:
- Self-produced electro-pop (bedroom studio, Sydney)
- Amazing Radio (UK) added it to rotation
- Triple J Home & Hosed history (played "Yearn" in August)
- 85 plays across 9 countries pre-release

Listen: [SPOTIFY LINK]

It's hypnotic, sultry, cinematic - strong empowerment narrative about choosing yourself over a past lover. The production quality is seriously impressive for a bedroom setup.

Worth a listen if you get a sec.

Best,
Chris

### Template D: AMAZING RADIO (Thank You + Social Post Request)

**Subject:** Thank you for the KYARA "Bloodshot" support!

**Body:**

```
Hi Amazing Radio team,

Just wanted to say a massive thank you for adding KYARA's "Bloodshot" to rotation!

The track officially dropped today, and having Amazing Radio support from day one is huge for Marie (KYARA). As a Sydney-based independent artist, getting UK radio support is a real milestone.

Quick ask: Would you be up for posting about it on socials? Even a quick "New music from Sydney artist KYARA" post would be amazing. Happy to provide any assets or info you need.

Also - if you want to interview Marie about the track, she'd be thrilled. Self-produced in her bedroom studio, strong empowerment narrative, Sydney indie scene connections... there's a good story there.

Thanks again for championing independent artists like KYARA!

Best,
Chris Schofield
Liberty Music PR
chrisschofield@libertymusicpr.com

P.S. The response has been great so far - 85 plays across 9 countries pre-release. Your support is making a real difference.
```

## DEMO NOTE FOR DAN (Friday)

**When showing this to Dan:**

"So this is the Monday release day blast I've got scheduled. It's going out Sunday night GMT to UK contacts, Monday morning AEST to Australian contacts. The tool:

 Auto-schedules send times based on timezone optimisation
 Segments the list (WARM, cold, new contacts)
 Tracks opens, clicks, responses automatically
 Suggests follow-up timing (Tuesday for non-openers)
 Integrates with Mailchimp for bulk send OR Gmail for personal sends

This alone saves me 2-3 hours of manual list management and scheduling. The tool does it all."

**The Value Prop for Dan:**

- **Time savings:** 2-3 hours per release day blast × 20 campaigns/month = 40-60 hours/month
- **Better targeting:** Timezone optimization + segmentation = higher open rates
- **Automated tracking:** No manual spreadsheet updates
- **Professional results:** Consistent, high-quality campaigns every time
