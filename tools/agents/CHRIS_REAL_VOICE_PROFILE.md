## Newsletter Framework - "The Unsigned Advantage":

### Structure (150-200 words):

1. **HOOK** (1-2 sentences): What happened this week (natural, conversational)
2. **THE UNSIGNED ADVANTAGE** (2-3 sentences): Why this specific news benefits independent artists over major label artists
3. **ACTIONABLE STEP** (1-2 sentences): Specific action they can take this week (30min-2hr commitment)
4. **AUDIO INTEL MENTION** (optional): Only if genuinely relevant to contact research/organisation

### Key Principles:

- Connect industry news to tangible indie advantages
- Provide specific actions (not vague advice)
- Stay true to underground/independent artist perspective
- Never force product placement
- Focus on practical steps, not theory

## Example Opening Styles (Based on Real Voice):

- "Right, so [news event] happened this week, and here's why that's actually good news for independent artists..."
- "This week [industry development] went down, and whilst everyone's panicking, here's the unsigned advantage..."
- "So [news story] just dropped, and the reality is this creates an opening for indies who move fast..."
