# KYARA - Australian Radio Pitch Emails

**Campaign**: KYARA New Single
**Genre**: Electro Pop
**Target**: Australian Radio (Triple J priority)
**Context**: Previous Triple J support ("Yearn" on Home & Hosed, Aug 2024)

---

## 🎯 Priority #1: Anika Luna (Triple J Home & Hosed)

**Email**: luna.anika@abc.net.au
**Relationship**: WARM - Triple J played KYARA's "Yearn" in August 2024
**Strategy**: Follow-up pitch referencing previous support

### Email Draft: Anika Luna (Home & Hosed)

**Subject**: KYARA - New single for Home & Hosed (following up from "Yearn")

Hi Anika,

Hope you're well! I'm reaching out on behalf of KYARA, whose debut single "Yearn" was played on Home & Hosed back in August by Jaimee Taylor-Neilsen.

Marie (KYARA) was absolutely thrilled with the support from Triple J - it meant the world to her as an emerging artist. Home & Hosed has been THE show she's been working towards since starting this project.

I'm writing because she has a new single coming out [INSERT RELEASE DATE], and given how well "Yearn" connected with the Home & Hosed audience, I thought you'd want to hear this one first.

The new track builds on that electro-pop sound but takes it further - [INSERT 1-2 SENTENCE DESCRIPTION OF NEW TRACK].

Would you be up for a listen? I can send you:

- High-quality WAV
- Spotify pre-save link
- Full press kit with artwork and bio

Really appreciate the support you've shown KYARA so far. Home & Hosed is genuinely the perfect home for her music.

Best,
Chris Schofield

## 🎯 Priority #2: Claire Mooney (Triple J Music Director)

**Email**: mooney.claire@abc.net.au
**Relationship**: COLD (but Triple J has supported KYARA before)
**Strategy**: Reference previous Home & Hosed play, position for broader rotation

### Email Draft: Claire Mooney (Music Director)

**Subject**: KYARA - New single (previously supported on Home & Hosed)

Hi Claire,

I'm Chris from Liberty Music PR, reaching out about KYARA's upcoming single.

Quick context: KYARA's debut single "Yearn" was played on Home & Hosed back in August, and it was a real milestone for her as an artist. The electro-pop sound really connected with the Triple J audience.

Her new track [TRACK NAME] is dropping [DATE], and I think it's ready for broader Triple J rotation beyond Home & Hosed. It's got:

- [KEY FEATURE 1 - e.g., "Infectious electro-pop hook"]
- [KEY FEATURE 2 - e.g., "Production that sits between Charli XCX and SBTRKT"]
- [KEY FEATURE 3 - e.g., "Already picking up support from UK stations"]

Would love to get this to you for consideration. Let me know if you're up for a listen and I'll send through the full package.

Cheers,
Chris Schofield

### Email Draft: Cold Australian Contacts

**Subject**: KYARA - New electro-pop single for [Station Name]

Hi [First Name],

I'm Chris from Liberty Music PR in the UK, reaching out about an artist I think would work really well for [Station Name].

KYARA is an electro-pop artist who's been building momentum both in the UK and Australia - her debut "Yearn" was played on Triple J's Home & Hosed, and she's picking up support from BBC Radio in the UK.

Her new single [TRACK NAME] drops [DATE], and I thought it'd be perfect for [SPECIFIC SHOW/TIMESLOT if known]. It's got that crossover appeal - think [ARTIST COMPARISON 1] meets [ARTIST COMPARISON 2].

Would you be up for a listen? Happy to send:

- High-quality WAV
- Streaming link
- Full press kit

Let me know if you're interested!

Best,
