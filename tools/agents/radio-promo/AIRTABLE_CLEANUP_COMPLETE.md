**Result**:
- Removed `jkhjksdhfmnm@gmail.com` (invalid test data)
- **517 → 516 contacts**

### 2. Mailchimp Status Sync ✅
**Task**: Sync subscription status from Mailchimp to Airtable
**Status**: Complete
**Result**:
- Processed all 516 contacts

- **Key Findings**:
  - 277 contacts already had correct status
  - 239 contacts not in Mailchimp (skipped - no valid Airtable status option)

### 3. Notes Field Consolidation ✅
**Task**: Merge Reply Notes and Description into single Notes field
**Status**: Complete
**Result**:
- **357 contacts updated** with consolidated notes
- **159 contacts had no notes** to merge
- Merged fields:
  - "Reply Notes" → "Notes" (with "REPLY:" prefix)
  - "Description" → "Notes" (with "DESCRIPTION:" prefix)
  - Existing "Notes" preserved
- **Cleared** "Reply Notes" and "Description" fields after merge

**Impact**: All contact intelligence is now in a single, organized "Notes" field - no more scattered information across 3 different fields.

### 4. AI Contact Enrichment 🔄 IN PROGRESS
**Task**: Enrich all 506 remaining contacts with AI intelligence
**Status**: Running in background
**Expected Completion**: ~8-10 minutes (506 contacts × 1 second rate limit)

- Adding **Enrichment Notes** with:
  - Station identification
  - Genre classification
  - Contact intelligence
  - Pitch strategy
  - Data quality assessment

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS (After Enrichment Completes)

### 1. Review High Quality Contacts
```bash
# Check enrichment results
cat ALL_CONTACTS_ENRICHMENT_REPORT.json
```

**Action**: Review the list of High Quality contacts and prioritize for campaigns

### 2. Extract Station Names from Enrichment
**Script**: `extract-stations-from-enrichment.js` (not yet created)
**Purpose**: Parse enrichment notes to populate missing station names

### 3. Auto-Tag Genres from Enrichment
**Script**: `auto-tag-genres-from-enrichment.js` (not yet created)
**Purpose**: Extract genre classifications from enrichment notes and tag contacts

### 4. Create Airtable Views
**Manual step in Airtable UI**:
- "Subscribed Contacts" (Status = Opted-In)
- "High Quality" (Enrichment Quality = High)
- "BBC & National" (Station contains "BBC" OR Quality = High)
- "Needs Genres" (Genres = empty)

## 🚨 IMPORTANT FINDINGS

- **Solution**: Now synced from Mailchimp, accurate subscription status

- **Plan**: Monthly (paid plan)
- **Total Contacts**: 475 (in Mailchimp)

- **Unsubscribed**: 22
- **Contacts Not in Mailchimp**: 239 (in Airtable but not in Mailchimp)

### Data Quality Issues:
- **Invalid Emails**: 1 (removed)
- **Missing Stations**: 60 (will be populated from enrichment)
- **No Genres**: 409 (will be auto-tagged from enrichment)
- **Duplicate Emails**: 0 (no duplicates found)
- **Test Contacts**: 2 (marked with Test Mode checkbox)
