Hi [Name],

Just following up on KYARA's "Bloodshot" email from earlier this week.

She's a Sydney artist with Triple J support, and I thought the track
would fit well with [Station/Show].

Link again: [LINK]

No pressure if it's not the right fit - just wanted to make sure it
landed in your inbox.

Cheers,
Chris
