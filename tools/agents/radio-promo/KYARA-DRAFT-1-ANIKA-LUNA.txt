SUBJECT: KYARA - "Bloodshot" for Home & Hosed (Sydney artist, following "Yearn")

PRIORITY: 1 - WARM CONTACT - SEND FIRST
STATION: Triple J - Home & Hosed

Hi Anika,

Hope you're well! I'm reaching out on behalf of KYARA - her debut single "Yearn" was played on Home & Hosed back in August by Jaimee Taylor-Neilsen.

Marie was absolutely thrilled with that support. As a Sydney-based artist, getting played on Home & Hosed was a real milestone for her.

I'm writing because she has a new single "Bloodshot" dropping TODAY (14th October), and given how well "Yearn" connected with the Home & Hosed audience, I thought you'd want to hear this one.

"Bloodshot" is a hypnotic electro-pop track - entirely self-written, recorded, and produced in her bedroom studio here in Sydney. It's an empowerment anthem about choosing yourself over a past lover. Sultry beats, ethereal melodies, and that same emotional storytelling that made "Yearn" resonate.

Think classic synthpop with a modern edge - it's got the intimacy of bedroom pop but sounds cinematic.

Would love to hear your thoughts. Given she's a Sydney artist with proven Triple J support, I think this could be a perfect fit for Home & Hosed.

Best,
