Hi Claire,

I'm Chris from Liberty Music PR, reaching out about Sydney-based artist KYARA's new single "Bloodshot", out today (14th October).

Quick context: KYARA's debut "Yearn" was played on Home & Hosed back in August, and it was a real milestone for her as a Sydney independent artist.

"Bloodshot" is her most accomplished track yet - self-produced in her bedroom studio, it's a hypnotic electro-pop anthem about empowerment and self-worth. The production is seriously impressive for a bedroom setup.

I think this is ready for broader Triple J rotation. It's got:
- Professional production quality (despite being bedroom-made)
- Sultry, cinematic soundscape (think classic synthpop meets modern electronica)
- Strong emotional storytelling (the "choosing yourself" narrative)
- Sydney local artist credentials

Following the Home & Hosed support, I reckon this could sit nicely in daytime rotation.

Would love to get your thoughts.

Cheers,
Chris Schofield
