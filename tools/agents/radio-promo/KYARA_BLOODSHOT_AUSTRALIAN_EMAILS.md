Hi Anika,

Hope you're well! I'm reaching out on behalf of KYARA - her debut single "Yearn"
was played on Home & Hosed back in August by Jaimee Taylor-Neilsen.

Marie was absolutely thrilled with that support. As a Sydney-based artist, getting
played on Home & Hosed was a real milestone for her.

I'm writing because she has a new single "Bloodshot" dropping TODAY (14th October),
and given how well "Yearn" connected with the Home & Hosed audience, I thought
you'd want to hear this one.

"Bloodshot" is a hypnotic electro-pop track - entirely self-written, recorded,
and produced in her bedroom studio here in Sydney. It's an empowerment anthem
about choosing yourself over a past lover. Sultry beats, ethereal melodies,
and that same emotional storytelling that made "Yearn" resonate.

Think classic synthpop with a modern edge - it's got the intimacy of bedroom
pop but sounds cinematic.

Would love to hear your thoughts. Given she's a Sydney artist with proven
Triple J support, I think this could be a perfect fit for Home & Hosed.

Best,

Hi Claire,

I'm Chris from Liberty Music PR, reaching out about Sydney-based artist KYARA's
new single "Bloodshot", out today (14th October).

Quick context: KYARA's debut "Yearn" was played on Home & Hosed back in August,
and it was a real milestone for her as a Sydney independent artist.

"Bloodshot" is her most accomplished track yet - self-produced in her bedroom
studio, it's a hypnotic electro-pop anthem about empowerment and self-worth.
The production is seriously impressive for a bedroom setup.

I think this is ready for broader Triple J rotation. It's got:
- Professional production quality (despite being bedroom-made)
- Sultry, cinematic soundscape (think classic synthpop meets modern electronica)
- Strong emotional storytelling (the "choosing yourself" narrative)
- Sydney local artist credentials

Following the Home & Hosed support, I reckon this could sit nicely in
daytime rotation.

Would love to get your thoughts.

Cheers,
Chris Schofield

## Priority #3: Triple R Melbourne (simonw@rrr.org.au)

**Angle**: Australian artist with Triple J support

### Email Draft: Triple R Melbourne

**Subject**: KYARA - Sydney electro-pop artist for Triple R

```
Hi Simon,

I'm Chris from Liberty Music PR in the UK, reaching out about Sydney-based
artist KYARA.

Her new single "Bloodshot" dropped today (14th October), and I thought it'd
be perfect for Triple R. She's been picking up support from Triple J
(Home & Hosed played her debut "Yearn"), and the new track is a step up.

Listen: [INSERT SPOTIFY LINK]
Download: [INSERT WETRANSFER LINK]

"Bloodshot" is hypnotic electro-pop - self-produced in her bedroom studio,
it's got sultry beats, ethereal melodies, and a strong empowerment narrative.
Think classic synthpop with a modern bedroom pop aesthetic.

As a Sydney independent artist doing everything herself (writing, recording,
production), I reckon this fits the Triple R ethos perfectly.

Worth a listen if you get a sec.

Best,
Chris Schofield

### Email Draft: PBS FM

**Subject**: KYARA - "Bloodshot" (Sydney electro-pop)

Hi Firas,

Quick one - Sydney artist KYARA has a new single "Bloodshot" out today that
I think would work well for PBS.

She's a bedroom producer/artist who's been getting Triple J support
(Home & Hosed played her debut), and this new track is seriously impressive.

Listen: [INSERT SPOTIFY LINK]

It's hypnotic electro-pop - self-produced, sultry, cinematic. Strong
empowerment narrative about choosing yourself over a past relationship.

Worth checking out if you're after new Australian electronic artists.

Cheers,
Chris

## Priority #5: KIIS 106.5 (music@kiis1065.com.au)

**Relationship**: COLD
**Angle**: Crossover pop potential, Sydney local

### Email Draft: KIIS 106.5

**Subject**: KYARA - "Bloodshot" (Sydney electro-pop, crossover potential)

```
Hi,

I'm Chris from Liberty Music PR, reaching out about Sydney artist KYARA's
new single "Bloodshot" (out today, 14th October).

She's been building momentum with Triple J support, and I think this track
has crossover pop potential for KIIS.

Listen: [INSERT SPOTIFY LINK]

"Bloodshot" is polished electro-pop with a catchy hook and sultry production.
It's got that indie credibility (bedroom-produced, Triple J-approved) but
sounds commercial enough for wider rotation.

Worth a listen if you're after new Sydney talent.

Best,
Chris Schofield
