Hi Firas,

Quick one - Sydney artist KYARA has a new single "Bloodshot" out today that I think would work well for PBS.

She's a bedroom producer/artist who's been getting Triple J support (Home & Hosed played her debut), and this new track is seriously impressive.

Listen: [INSERT SPOTIFY LINK]

It's hypnotic electro-pop - self-produced, sultry, cinematic. Strong empowerment narrative about choosing yourself over a past relationship.

Worth checking out if you're after new Australian electronic artists.

Cheers,
Chris
