Hi Simon,

I'm Chris from Liberty Music PR in the UK, reaching out about Sydney-based artist KYARA.

Her new single "Bloodshot" dropped today (14th October), and I thought it'd be perfect for Triple R. She's been picking up support from Triple J (Home & Hosed played her debut "Yearn"), and the new track is a step up.

"Bloodshot" is hypnotic electro-pop - self-produced in her bedroom studio, it's got sultry beats, ethereal melodies, and a strong empowerment narrative. Think classic synthpop with a modern bedroom pop aesthetic.

As a Sydney independent artist doing everything herself (writing, recording, production), I reckon this fits the Triple R ethos perfectly.

Worth a listen if you get a sec.

Best,
Chris Schofield
