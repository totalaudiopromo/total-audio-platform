##  Professional Email Structure for KYARA

### For Anika Luna (Warm - Triple J)

**Subject**: KYARA - New single for Home & Hosed (following up from "Yearn")

**Body** (Plain text, no HTML):

```
Hi Anika,

Hope you're well! I'm reaching out on behalf of KYARA, whose debut single
"Yearn" was played on Home & Hosed back in August by Jaimee Taylor-Neilsen.

Marie was absolutely thrilled with the support from Triple J - Home & Hosed
has been THE show she's been working towards since starting this project.

I'm writing because she has a new single "[TRACK NAME]" dropping [DATE],
and given how well "Yearn" connected with the Home & Hosed audience, I
thought you'd want to hear this one first.

Listen here: [Spotify pre-save link]
Download WAV: [WeTransfer link]

The new track builds on that electro-pop sound but takes it further -
[1-2 sentence description].

About KYARA:
Marie is a UK-based electro-pop artist who's been building momentum both
in the UK and Australia. Following the Triple J support for "Yearn", she's
also picked up plays from BBC Radio and several UK indie stations.

Would love to hear your thoughts on the new track.

Best,
Chris Schofield
