Chris: That's a solid budget. This is high priority for us - Emily's been building great traction.

Artist Rep: Yes, we're seeing good streaming numbers already. We want to target indie radio stations and BBC Introducing specifically.

Artist Rep: That sounds great. We want full transparency on results.

Chris: Absolutely. We'll target Amazing Radio, Wigwam Radio, and our network of indie stations. The deadline for getting everything set up is October 1st.

Artist Rep: Perfect timing. Emily's really excited about this campaign.

Chris: We'll make sure to get BBC Introducing submissions in early and focus on stations that play indie pop. This should be a great success.
