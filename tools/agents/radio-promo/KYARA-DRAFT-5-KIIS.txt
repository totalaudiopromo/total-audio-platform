Hi,

I'm Chris from Liberty Music PR, reaching out about Sydney artist KYARA's new single "Bloodshot" (out today, 14th October).

She's been building momentum with Triple J support, and I think this track has crossover pop potential for KIIS.

Listen: [INSERT SPOTIFY LINK]

"Bloodshot" is polished electro-pop with a catchy hook and sultry production. It's got that indie credibility (bedroom-produced, Triple J-approved) but sounds commercial enough for wider rotation.

Worth a listen if you're after new Sydney talent.

Best,
Chris Schofield
