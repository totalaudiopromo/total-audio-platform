## TECHNICAL CHANGES

### Command Interface Fixes

**tdd-ui-planner.js**:

- Expects: `create`, `quick`, `list`
- Orchestrator now calls: `create` 

**tdd-component-selector.js**:

- Expects: `select`, `quick`, `list`
- Orchestrator now calls: `select` 

**tdd-test-writer.js**:

- Expects: `write`, `quick`, `list`
- Orchestrator now calls: `write` 

**tdd-implementation-planner.js**:

- Expects: `create`, `quick`, `list`
- Orchestrator now calls: `create`  (was incorrectly calling `plan`)

### Validation Added

```javascript
// Product line validation with graceful fallback
const validProducts = ['audiointel', 'playlistpulse'];
if (!validProducts.includes(productLine)) {
  logger.warn(`Invalid product line: ${productLine}. Defaulting to 'audiointel'`);
  productLine = 'audiointel';
}
```

### Error Handling Improved

```javascript
// Graceful JSON parsing with fallback
try {
  return JSON.parse(result);
} catch (parseError) {
  return {
    agent: agentName,
    feature: featureName,
    output: result.trim(),
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  };
}
```

## PRO TIPS

### Aliases (Optional but Recommended)

Add to your `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# Agent OS shortcuts
alias agents="cd /Users/chrisschofield/workspace/active/total-audio-platform/tools/agents && node unified-launcher.js dashboard"

alias tdd-status="cd /Users/chrisschofield/workspace/active/total-audio-platform/tools/agents && node unified-launcher.js tdd-status"
```

Then reload: `source ~/.zshrc`

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# Morning routine
agents                                    # See dashboard
agent-health                              # Check system health
