**The Unsigned Advantage**
by Chris Schofield

Right, so it's kicking off in the AI music world. A group of independent musicians have just launched a massive lawsuit against Suno and Udio, claiming these AI companies nicked their work to train their algorithms. The fascinating bit? It's not major labels leading the charge - it's indies banding together.

Here's the thing: independent artists have always been more nimble when it comes to protecting their rights. After 5+ years in radio promotion, I've seen how indies can move fast whilst the majors are still stuck in meetings. This lawsuit proves it - whilst big labels are still debating their AI strategy, independent artists have already organised and taken action.

Your move: Take 90 minutes this week to audit where your music appears online. Search your artist name plus "AI dataset" or "training data" in Google. If you spot your work being used without permission, screenshot everything and save it in a folder. Join indie artist communities discussing this issue - there's strength in numbers, and the next class action might need your evidence.

The majors might have the lawyers, but we've got the advantage of speed and collective action.

Let me know if you spot anything dodgy,
Chris
