       * We cannot use resizeTo because it includes the title bar height

       * So we could calculate delta from body dimensions and use resizeBy instead
       * Still, we don't resize the width: we fix it to 340px which is standard size
       * on macOS
       * We don't resize the height - because it can visibly appear jumping to users
       * if we are resizing after the notification has loaded
       * This comment is left as warning: please don't bother dynamically resizing the
       * notification window
