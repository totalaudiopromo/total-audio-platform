## Email 1: Initial Outreach (Send TODAY)

**Subject:** Save 15+ hours/week on contact research

**Body:**
```
Hi [FIRST NAME],

I help radio promoters save massive time on contact research.

Most promoters waste 15+ hours per week manually researching:
- Station contacts & submission guidelines
- Genre focus & artist types
- Coverage areas & audience reach
- Best pitch angles for each contact

Audio Intel automates all of this.

Upload your contact list → Get detailed intelligence in minutes.

See if it works for you in 5 minutes.

Best,
Chris

Manual contact research is killing your productivity.

**Body:**
```
[FIRST NAME],

Last message from me.

If you're happy spending hours on manual contact research, ignore this.

But if you'd rather spend that time on actual promotion work, give Audio Intel a shot.

Free access: intel.totalaudiopromo.com

Takes 2 minutes to try. Could save you 15+ hours per week.

Your call.

Chris

P.S. If this isn't relevant, reply "not interested" and I won't bother you again.
