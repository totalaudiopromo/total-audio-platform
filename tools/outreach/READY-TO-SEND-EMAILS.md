## Email 1: The Problem (Send immediately)

**Subject:** Stop wasting 15 hours a week on radio research

Hey {{first_name}},

Quick question: how long did you spend last week researching radio contacts?

If you're like most promoters I talk to, it's probably 10-15 hours of:

- Googling station names
- Hunting for email addresses
- Checking if contacts are still there
- Updating your spreadsheets

There's a better way.

Audio Intel is a contact enrichment tool built specifically for UK music promotion. Upload a list of radio stations, get back verified contacts with emails, phone numbers, and current roles in minutes.

£19.99/month. No demos, no sales calls.

P.S. Built this because I was sick of paying £300/month for Cision when I only needed basic contact info.

## Email 2: The Solution (Send after 3 days)

**Subject:** Here's exactly how Audio Intel works

{{first_name}},

Wanted to show you what Audio Intel actually does:

**Your old process:**

1. Google "BBC Radio 1 music producer"
2. Click through 8 outdated articles
3. Find a name from 2019
4. Try to guess their email format
5. Send and pray
6. Repeat 50 times

**Audio Intel process:**

1. Upload station names (CSV or paste)
2. AI researches current contacts
3. Get verified emails, roles, phone numbers
4. Export and start pitching

**Real example:**
"BBC Radio 1" → Returns:

- Jack Saunders (New Music Specialist)
- jack.saunders@bbc.co.uk
- Direct line: +44 20 7765 xxxx
- Updated: October 2025

Takes 30 seconds vs. 30 minutes.

Try it yourself: intel.totalaudiopromo.com

£19.99/month for 100 contacts. Agency plans available.

## Email 3: The Close (Send after 3 more days)

**Subject:** Last thing on Audio Intel

{{first_name}},

Not trying to spam you, but I wanted to share why I built this.

I spent 5+ years doing radio promotion. Every campaign started the same way: 2 days of contact research before I could even start pitching.

Cision costs £300+/month. Muck Rack is £400+/month. Both are overkill if you just need contact info.

Audio Intel does one thing really well: finds current radio contacts fast.

**Who it's for:**

- Independent promoters doing 3-5 campaigns/month
- Small PR agencies sick of paying for Cision
- Artists doing their own radio push

**Who it's NOT for:**

- Big agencies with Cision budgets (stick with what works)
- People who only do 1-2 campaigns/year (not worth it)

If this sounds like you, give it a try: intel.totalaudiopromo.com

30-day money back guarantee. Cancel anytime.

## Tips

**Subject Lines:**

- Keep under 50 characters
- Lead with the pain point
- Avoid "Re:" tricks (feels spammy)

**Email Body:**

- Short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)
- One clear CTA
- No attachments

**Timing:**

- Send Tuesday-Thursday
- 9am or 2pm GMT
- Avoid Mondays (inbox overload) and Fridays (weekend mode)

**Follow-up:**

- Wait 3 days between emails
- Stop after 3 emails (respect the no)
- If they reply, remove from sequence

---

## What NOT to Do

 Send all 3 emails in one day
 Buy email lists (terrible quality)
 Use merge tags wrong ({{first_name}} must match CSV column)
 Send from noreply@ address (kills replies)
 Make it about you (make it about their problem)

---

## Questions?

This is a proven outreach system for SaaS. The emails are ready to send as-is, but personalise if you want.

**Key metric:** If you're not getting 30%+ open rates, your subject lines need work. If you're not getting 5%+ click rates, your offer needs work.

Start with 30 contacts. Test. Scale what works.
