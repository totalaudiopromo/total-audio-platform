## Demo Script (7 Minutes)

### Opening Hook (30 seconds) | 0:00-0:30

### Part 1: Audio Intel - Contact Research (2 minutes) | 0:30-2:30

#### Current Process Reminder (15 seconds)

**Say:**
"Today, when Sam gets a new indie rock artist to pitch, he spends about 15 hours researching BBC Radio contacts. Let me show you what that looks like with Audio Intel."

---

#### Live Demo: Enrichment (30 seconds) | 0:45-1:15

**Do:**
1. Open Audio Intel dashboard
2. Click "BBC Radio Contacts"
3. Show 45+ contacts appear instantly

**Say (while clicking):**
"Open Audio Intel, click BBC Radio contacts, and... done. 45 BBC Radio contacts, enriched in 30 seconds. Not 15 hours."

**Key Visual:** Emphasize the speed (30 seconds) vs current (15 hours)

---

#### Show Contact Details (45 seconds) | 1:15-2:00

**Do:**
1. Click on "Jack Saunders - BBC Radio 1 Future Sounds"
2. Show contact card with details:
   - Email address
   - Show name and format
   - Submission preferences
   - Recent artists played
   - Genre focus

**Say:**
"Here's Jack Saunders. Audio Intel shows:
- His direct contact email - not the generic BBC inbox
- Future Sounds show format - indie, alternative, new music
- Submission preferences - how he likes to receive music
- Recent artists he's supported - so you can reference them in your pitch

Everything Sam needs to know, in one place. No Google searches. No LinkedIn stalking. No asking around the industry."

---

#### Filter and Export (30 seconds) | 2:00-2:30

**Do:**
1. Filter contacts by genre: "Indie/Alternative"
2. Show 12-15 contacts filtered
3. Click "Export to CSV"

**Say:**
"Filter by genre - show me just indie and alternative presenters. 15 contacts perfect for this artist. Export to CSV for my spreadsheet, or push directly to Campaign Tracker.

**Current time: 15 hours. With Audio Intel: 30 seconds. That's Sam's #1 pain point - solved.**"

**Pause for Effect:** Let the time savings sink in (3 second silence)

---

### Part 2: Pitch Generator - AI-Powered Pitches (2.5 minutes) | 2:30-5:00

#### Current Process Reminder (15 seconds)

**Say:**
"Now Sam needs to write personalised pitches for each of these contacts. Currently takes 2-3 hours per campaign. Watch this."

---

#### Live Demo: Generate Pitch for Jack Saunders (1 minute) | 2:45-3:45

**Do:**
1. Open Pitch Generator
2. Fill in form:
   - Artist name: "The Wilderness" (example)
   - Genre: "Indie rock"
   - Key info: "Debut single 'Northern Lights', UK tour Oct-Nov, BBC Introducing featured"
   - Streaming link: [paste link]
3. Select target: "Jack Saunders - BBC Radio 1 Future Sounds"
4. Click "Generate Pitch"
5. **Wait 15-30 seconds** (let AI work - don't apologise for wait time, this is still fast)

**Say (while filling in form):**
"Enter the artist details - name, genre, key talking points, streaming link. Select target contact - Jack Saunders. Click generate."

**Say (during 15-30 second generation):**
"The AI is analysing Jack's show format, his recent playlists, the artist's style, and generating a personalised pitch..."

---

#### Show Generated Pitch (1 minute) | 3:45-4:45

**Do:**
1. Generated pitch appears
2. Scroll through pitch slowly (let them read key parts)
3. Highlight personalisation elements:
   - Custom greeting to Jack
   - Reference to Future Sounds show
   - Mention of similar artists Jack's played
   - Show-specific angle

**Say:**
"And here's the pitch. Notice:
- Personal greeting to Jack, not generic
- References Future Sounds specifically - 'I think this would fit perfectly on your Friday New Music drop'
- Mentions similar artists Jack's supported - 'Fans of [artist Jack recently played]'
- Show format-aware - knows Future Sounds focuses on discovery, not mainstream

This isn't a template. This is an AI that understands Jack Saunders' show and creates a pitch that sounds like a music publicist who knows him."

---

**Do:**
1. Click "Edit Pitch"
2. Make a small change (add a sentence or tweak wording)
3. Show "Copy to Clipboard" button

**Say:**
"You're still in control. Edit any part - add personal touches, adjust tone, reference a recent conversation with Jack. The AI gives you an 80% complete pitch in 30 seconds, you refine to 100% in 10-15 minutes.

Total time: 15 minutes instead of 2-3 hours. That's Sam's #2 pain point - solved."

"Here's a live campaign. Campaign Tracker shows:
- All contacts from Audio Intel - no need to re-enter
- Who's been contacted, who responded, who passed
- Which team member is handling each contact - prevents duplicate outreach
- Real-time activity feed - 'Sarah contacted Jack Saunders at 10:42am today'

---

### Closing Summary (30 seconds) | 7:45-8:15

**Say:**
"Let's recap what you just saw in 7 minutes:

**Audio Intel:** 15 hours of contact research → 30 seconds
**Pitch Generator:** 2-3 hours of pitch writing → 15 minutes
**Campaign Tracker:** Spreadsheet coordination chaos → Real-time visibility
**Client Reporting:** 3-5 hours manual compilation → 30-minute export

Per campaign: 20+ hours saved. At 10 campaigns per month: 200+ hours saved. At £30/hour: £6,000/month value for a £1,000/month cost.

**That's the workflow transformation I'm proposing for Liberty Music PR.**"

## Demo Tips & Best Practices

### Energy & Pacing

**Do:**
- Speak with enthusiasm (you're excited about saving them time)
- Pause after key moments (let value sink in)
- Make eye contact (don't just stare at screen)
- Use hand gestures (emphasise key points)

**Don't:**
- Rush through demo (they need to absorb)
- Apologise for tool limitations (own it)
- Get lost in technical details (stay high-level)
- Let silence become awkward (pause is powerful, but know when to continue)

---

### Handling Technical Issues

**If Audio Intel doesn't load:**
1. Say: "Let me show you screenshots while this loads" (have backup ready)
2. Switch to prepared screenshots
3. Maintain energy (don't panic)

**If pitch generation takes longer than 30 seconds:**
1. Say: "While the AI works, let me explain what it's doing..." (fill time productively)
2. Explain personalisation logic
3. By time you're done explaining, pitch should be ready

**If Campaign Tracker demo fails:**
1. Say: "Let me show you the client report export first, then circle back" (reorder demo)
2. Use backup video or screenshots
3. Offer to send full demo video later

### Personalisation for Liberty

**Reference Liberty-Specific Details:**
- "Sam's team" (not "your team" - show you know structure)
- "40+ freelancers" (acknowledge scale)
- "Jack Saunders, Clara Amfo" (mention actual contacts they pitch)
- "BBC Introducing across 40 regions" (show UK knowledge)
- "LA and NY offices" (acknowledge international growth)

**Chris's Credibility:**
- "As you know, I do radio promo work for Liberty, so I've lived these pain points"
- "This is the tool I wished I had when pitching BBC Radio for your campaigns"

---

### Reading the Room

**Watch for:**

**Engaged Signals:**
- Leaning forward
- Taking notes
- Nodding
- Asking questions during demo
→ **Action:** Continue at pace, encourage questions

**Skeptical Signals:**
- Arms crossed
- Checking phone
- Glazed eyes
- No note-taking
→ **Action:** Pause, ask "What concerns do you have so far?"

**Confused Signals:**
- Furrowed brow
- Hesitant questions
- "Wait, how does that work?"
→ **Action:** Slow down, clarify, repeat key point

---

### Questions to Encourage During Demo

**Strategic Pauses for Questions:**

**After Audio Intel demo:**
"Any questions on contact research before I show pitching?"

**After Pitch Generator demo:**
"Thoughts on the pitch quality? Does it sound like your team's tone?"

**After Campaign Tracker demo:**
"Questions on how this would work with your 40+ freelancers?"

**Anticipated Questions (be ready):**

"**Can we edit the AI pitches?**"
→ "Absolutely - you saw me edit the Jack Saunders pitch. You control every word."

"**What if contact details are wrong?**"
→ "We verify contacts monthly. If you find an error, flag it - we update within 24 hours. You can also add your own contacts."

"**How do freelancers access this?**"
→ "Team accounts - everyone logs in with their email. You control permissions (some freelancers view-only, others full access)."

"**What about data privacy?**"
→ "Your data stays yours. We don't sell contact data to others. You can export everything at any time."
