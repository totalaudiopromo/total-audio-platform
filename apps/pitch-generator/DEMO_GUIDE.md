# Pitch Generator - Quick Demo Guide

**Production URL:** https://pitch.totalaudiopromo.com
**Demo Time:** 4 minutes
**Key Message:** "This is my actual workflow - saves 14 hours per campaign"

## 🎯 The Honest Pitch

**What it actually does:**
- You add contacts + relationship notes (from research/Audio Intel)
- AI generates personalised pitches using that context
- Scale: 50 pitches in 25 minutes vs 16 hours manual

**What it doesn't do:**
- ❌ Automatically "know" contact history
- ❌ Magic relationship tracking
- ✅ BUT: Stores your research and reuses it perfectly across unlimited pitches

## 📋 4-Minute Demo Script

### 1. Homepage (30s)
> "I was spending 16 hours per campaign writing personalised pitches. Built this to get those hours back. Watch..."

### 2. Add Contact + Generate (2m)
**Add a real contact you know:**
- Name, role, outlet
- **Notes field:** "Previously supported [artist], plays [genre]"
- Enter track details
- Click Generate → **30 seconds**

> "I documented the relationship once. Now watch the AI use that context..."

### 3. The Kicker (1m)
**Show the math:**
- Generate 2-3 more pitches for different contacts (90 seconds total)
- "Three pitches, 90 seconds. Without this? 60 minutes of careful writing."
- "Multiply by 50 contacts = 16 hours saved per campaign"

### 4. Pricing (30s)
- PRO: £14/month = unlimited pitches
- "First campaign saves 16 hours. Tool pays for itself in 15 minutes."

## 💡 Real Demo Contacts (If Needed)

**Only use real contacts you actually work with. If demoing to Dan, consider:**

1. A BBC contact you've worked with
2. A Triple J contact (if relevant)
3. A UK indie station contact

**Be honest in demo:**
> "This is [Contact Name] at [Station]. I know they [what you actually know]. Adding that to notes so AI can reference it..."

## 🚀 The WOW Moment

**Live generation with timer visible:**
1. Start timer
2. Generate 3 pitches for different contacts
3. Stop at ~90 seconds
4. "Read them - they're not templates. Each one's perfectly personalised."

**Then show sent emails if you have them:**
> "These aren't mocks - here's the actual pitch I sent yesterday..." [Gmail]

## ⚠️ What NOT to Say

❌ "The AI automatically knows your contacts"
✅ "The AI remembers what you document and uses it perfectly"

❌ "It magically tracks relationships"
✅ "It stores your research once and reuses it across unlimited pitches"

❌ "This replaces your expertise"
✅ "This amplifies your expertise - you research once, generate unlimited pitches"
