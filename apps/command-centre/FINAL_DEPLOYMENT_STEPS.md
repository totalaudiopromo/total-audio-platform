#  FINAL DEPLOYMENT STEPS - Mobile Sidebar Fix

##  Current Status:

-  Mobile fixes are in commit `85487e3` (and `43282db`)
-  Code pushed to GitHub: `totalaudiopromo/command-centre`
-  Vercel CLI blocked by team permissions
-  GitHub webhook NOT triggering automatic deployments
-  Mobile fixes NOT yet live on production

##  IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

Since the Vercel CLI is blocked and GitHub webhooks aren't working, you need to **manually trigger deployment from the Vercel Dashboard**:

### **Step 1: Go to Vercel Deployments**

Open: https://vercel.com/chris-projects-6ffe0e29/command-centre/deployments

### **Step 2: Click "Create Deployment"**

Look for a button that says:

- "Deploy" or
- "Create Deployment" or
- "+ New Deployment"

### **Step 3: Select Settings**

- **Branch**: `main`
- **Commit**: Should auto-select latest (85487e3)
- Click **"Deploy"**

### **Alternative: Re-connect Git Integration**

If you don't see a deploy button:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/chris-projects-6ffe0e29/command-centre/settings/git
2. Under "Git Repository":
   - If it shows "Connected" → Click "Disconnect" then "Connect" again
   - If it shows "Not Connected" → Click "Connect Git Repository"
3. Select: `totalaudiopromo/command-centre`
4. This should trigger an immediate deployment

##  What's Being Deployed:

**Commit**: `85487e3` (trigger: Deploy mobile sidebar fixes to production)
**Previous**: `43282db` (fix: Mobile sidebar overlay z-index and dashboard responsive design)

**Files Changed**:

- `app/components/AppShell.tsx` - Fixed mobile sidebar z-index and overlay
- `app/components/TotalAudioDashboard.tsx` - Responsive dashboard with error handling

**Mobile Fixes**:

-  Dark overlay (bg-black bg-opacity-50) at z-40
-  Sidebar at z-50 (above overlay)
-  Full height sidebar (h-screen) on mobile
-  44px touch targets on all navigation items
-  Proper stacking order (no more light grey blocking!)

##  After Deployment - Test on Mobile:

1. **Hard Refresh**: Close and reopen https://command.totalaudiopromo.com
2. **Tap burger menu** ( icon top left)
3. **Expected Result**:
   - Dark semi-transparent overlay appears
   - White sidebar slides in from left (ABOVE overlay)
   - All navigation items are clickable
   - Tap overlay or X button closes sidebar

##  Troubleshooting:

### If webhook still doesn't work after reconnecting:

Check GitHub webhook at: https://github.com/totalaudiopromo/command-centre/settings/hooks

- Should see a Vercel webhook
- Click "Recent Deliveries" to see if it's firing
- If missing, the git reconnection in Vercel will create it

### If you see old code after deployment:

The Vercel cache may be serving old code. Check:

1. Deployment page shows correct commit hash (85487e3)
2. Clear browser cache on mobile
3. Try in incognito/private mode

---

**Bottom Line**: The code is ready and on GitHub. You just need to manually trigger the deployment from the Vercel dashboard because:

1. CLI is blocked by team permissions
2. GitHub webhook isn't auto-deploying

Once you click "Deploy" in the Vercel dashboard, your mobile fixes will be live in ~1-2 minutes!
