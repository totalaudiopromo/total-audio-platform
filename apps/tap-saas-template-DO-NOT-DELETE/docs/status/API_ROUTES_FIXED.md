#  API ROUTES FIXED - Data Loading Issues Resolved

##  **What Was Fixed**

### **API Route User ID Issues**

The main problem was that the frontend pages were using `session.user.email` as the user ID, but the API routes were looking for `session.user.id`. This caused authentication mismatches and empty data responses.

### **Changes Made:**

#### **1. Fixed User ID Consistency**

-  **Stats API** (`/api/stats`) - Now uses `session.user.email`
-  **Pitches API** (`/api/pitches`) - Now uses `session.user.email`
-  **Contacts API** (`/api/contacts`) - Now uses `session.user.email` + added user filtering

#### **2. Updated Frontend Data Loading**

-  **Dashboard** - Now uses API routes instead of direct Supabase calls
-  **Pitch History** - Now uses API routes instead of direct Supabase calls
-  **Better Error Handling** - Proper error catching and logging

### **3. API Route Improvements**

-  **Contacts API** - Added proper user_id filtering
-  **Consistent Response Format** - All APIs return standardized JSON
-  **Proper Error Handling** - Better error messages and status codes

##  **What You'll See Now**

**Refresh your browser** at http://localhost:3010 and navigate to:

1. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - Should now load stats and recent pitches
2. **Pitch History** (`/pitch/history`) - Should now show your pitch library
3. **Contacts** (`/pitch/contacts`) - Should now load your contacts

##  **Expected Results**

**No more empty data errors!** You should now see:

-  Dashboard stats (total pitches, sent pitches, etc.)
-  Recent pitches list
-  Pitch history with proper data
-  Contact management working
-  All API calls succeeding

##  **Still Need Demo Data?**

If you're still seeing empty lists, you need to run the demo data script:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the `add-demo-data.sql` script
4. Refresh your browser

This will populate your database with sample contacts and pitches for testing.

**The data loading nightmare is over!** 

Try navigating to the dashboard and pitch history pages now - you should see actual data instead of empty error messages!
