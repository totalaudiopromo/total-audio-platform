# AUDIO INTEL - CURSOR DEVELOPMENT RULES

## 🎯 REVENUE-FIRST DEVELOPMENT

**Audio Intel is THE business priority.** Every line of code must justify itself through customer acquisition or revenue generation.

### Core Product
- **Function**: Contact enrichment for music industry professionals
- **Market**: UK alternative to expensive US tools (SubmitHub £200-500+/month)
- **Pricing**: £19.99/month Pro, £39.99/month Agency
- **Status**: Pre-revenue, targeting first £500/month

## 🛠️ TECHNICAL STANDARDS

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, no `any` types ever
- **Components**: Functional with hooks, follow existing patterns
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Performance**: Mobile-first, fast loading, responsive design
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failures, user-friendly messages

### UK Context Always
- **Currency**: £GBP for all pricing/financial components
- **Spelling**: British spelling (organisation, colour, realise)
- **Content**: Music industry terminology, UK market focus
- **Data**: GDPR compliant, UK-focused validation

### Architecture Patterns
- **File Structure**: Group by feature, follow existing patterns
- **API Routes**: RESTful design, proper error codes
- **Database**: Prisma with proper relations and types
- **Payments**: Stripe integration with webhook handling
- **External APIs**: Perplexity for contact enrichment

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES

### Must Do
- ✅ Test complete user journey: signup → upload → results → payment
- ✅ Mobile responsive design (family man working on laptop)
- ✅ Real music industry data structures and validation
- ✅ Stripe subscription flow with proper error handling
- ✅ CSV processing with various formats and edge cases

### Never Do
- ❌ Build features without revenue justification
- ❌ Add V2 features until V1 generates £500/month
- ❌ Use generic business terminology (use music industry specific)
- ❌ Break existing user workflows
- ❌ Create performance bottlenecks

### Development Focus
- **Primary**: Customer acquisition features
- **Secondary**: User experience optimization
- **Forbidden**: Nice-to-have features, experimental additions

## 🎵 USER CONTEXT

### Target Users
- **Independent artists**: Running their own radio campaigns

### Real Use Cases
- Upload email list from spreadsheet
- Get enhanced contact data with roles, companies, social links
- Export results for immediate use in campaigns
- Track usage and manage subscription

### Pain Points Being Solved
- Hours of manual contact research → Minutes of automated enrichment
- Expensive US tools → Affordable UK alternative
- Scattered contact info → Organized, actionable intelligence

## 📋 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW
