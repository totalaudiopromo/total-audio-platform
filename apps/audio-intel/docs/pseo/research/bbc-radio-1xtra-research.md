   - Complete your artist profile with detailed biography

2. **Upload Allowance**
   - **Maximum**: 2 tracks per month
   - **Guarantee**: BBC Introducing team will listen within 6 months
   - **Strategy**: Submit most radio-ready single first, then demonstrate breadth with second upload

3. **Regional Review Process**
   - Dedicated regional teams review submissions first
   - Best tracks played on local BBC shows
   - Exceptional tracks forwarded to national stations (Radio 1, 1Xtra, 6 Music, etc.)

4. **Path to 1Xtra**
   - Regional BBC Introducing presenter champions your track
   - Track forwarded to 1Xtra music team based on genre fit
   - Weekly playlist meetings feature Introducing artists
   - If successful, featured on relevant 1Xtra show

### Critical Submission Requirements

**CLEAN VERSIONS ONLY**

- **No explicit language**- tracks with swearing will not be considered
- BBC broadcast standards apply to all submissions
- Upload clean radio edits, not album versions with explicit content
- **Source**: [Ditto Music BBC Introducing Guide](https://dittomusic.com/en/blog/how-to-get-your-music-played-on-bbc-introducing/), [ICMP BBC Introducing Guide](https://www.icmp.ac.uk/blog/inside-bbc-music-introducing)

**Audio Quality Standards**

- Professional quality MP3 (high bitrate)
- Final mastered versions only
- No unfinished lyrics, no out-of-tune instruments

**Complete Artist Information**

- Full contact details (required for immediate follow-up)
- Artist biography and story in Release Notes section
- Influences and genre tags
- Social media and streaming links

### Submission Strategy Tips

**From BBC Introducing Presenters:**

1. **Radio-Ready First**: Submit your most accessible, radio-ready single with your first monthly upload
2. **Demonstrate Breadth**: Use second upload to show creative range
3. **Tell Your Story**: Release Notes section is invaluable for connecting listener to music
4. **Be Original**: BBC Introducing champions music that pushes boundaries, not copies trends
5. **Quality Over Quantity**: Only submit when track is genuinely ready for national radio
6. **Patience Required**: All uploads listened to within 6 months - great music will be heard

## Common Mistakes for 1Xtra Submissions

### 1. **Submitting Explicit Content**

**Mistake**: Uploading tracks with swearing, explicit language, or adult themes
**Result**: Immediate rejection - won't be considered for any BBC airplay
**Solution**: Always submit clean radio edits that meet BBC broadcast standards

### 2. **Poor Audio Quality**

**Mistake**: Uploading unfinished mixes, demo quality, or unmastered tracks
**Result**: Rejected in first 30 seconds of listening
**Solution**: Only submit professional, radio-ready final masters

### 3. **Incomplete Artist Profile**

**Mistake**: Missing contact info, no biography, generic release notes
**Result**: Even if track is good, presenters can't follow up or context is missing
**Solution**: Complete all profile fields, write compelling artist story in Release Notes

### 4. **Genre Mismatch**

**Mistake**: Submitting music that doesn't fit 1Xtra's urban music remit
**Result**: Track not forwarded from regional team to 1Xtra
**Solution**: Ensure music genuinely fits grime/hip-hop/Afrobeats/R&B/dancehall genres

### 5. **Submitting Too Early**

**Mistake**: Uploading tracks before they're genuinely radio-ready to "get feedback"
**Result**: Missed opportunity - you only get 2 uploads per month
**Solution**: Treat BBC Introducing as a professional submission, not a demo platform

### 6. **Weak First 30 Seconds**

**Mistake**: Long intros, slow builds, burying the hook
**Result**: Track skipped before best parts are heard
**Solution**: Front-load your best musical ideas - first 30 seconds must grab attention

### 7. **No Social Media / Streaming Presence**

**Mistake**: Submitting with no online presence for presenters to reference
**Result**: Harder to champion artist with no digital footprint
**Solution**: Build basic artist presence (Spotify, Instagram, etc.) before submission

### 8. **Impatience**

**Mistake**: Repeatedly emailing or uploading same track under different names
**Result**: Flagged as unprofessional, damages reputation
**Solution**: Submit once, wait the guaranteed 6-month review period
