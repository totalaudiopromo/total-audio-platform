## 6. Common Mistakes Artists Make

### Critical Errors to Avoid

**1. Submitting Poor Audio Quality**

**The Mistake**:
- Low-quality MP3 files instead of WAV
- Rough demos or poorly mixed tracks
- Unmastered audio
- Inconsistent volume levels

**Why It Fails**: Audio quality standards for playlist inclusion are non-negotiable. Poor quality signals amateur production and guarantees immediate rejection.

**The Fix**: Professional mixing and mastering, proper file formats (WAV/FLAC), quality control before distribution.

**Source**: [iMusician - Playlist Submission Mistakes](https://imusician.pro/en/resources/blog/playlist-submission-mistakes)

**2. Incorrect Submission Timing**

**The Mistake**:
- Submitting 2-3 days before release
- Assuming last-minute submissions are acceptable
- Not accounting for distributor processing time

**Why It Fails**: Apple Music editorial team needs minimum 7-10 days for review. Late submissions miss consideration windows entirely.

**The Fix**:
- Schedule distributor pitch 10+ days before release
- Allow 3-4 weeks for maximum consideration
- Account for distributor processing time (add 2-3 days)

**Source**: [Apple Music Pitch User Guide](https://itunespartner.apple.com/music/support/5391-apple-music-pitch-user-guide)

**3. Misunderstanding Apple Music's Closed System**

**The Mistake**:
- Assuming there's a public submission portal like Spotify
- Trying to contact curators directly via social media
- Expecting to pitch directly without a distributor

**Why It Fails**: Apple Music operates a closed editorial system. Only approved distributors can submit pitches.

**The Fix**:
- Verify your distributor has Apple Music Pitch access
- Work through proper distributor channels
- Build relationships rather than cold outreach

**Source**: [Playlist Push - Apple Music Guide](https://playlistpush.com/blog/how-to-get-on-apple-music-playlists-a-guide-for-independent-artists/)

**4. Incomplete or Poor Metadata**

**The Mistake**:
- Missing contributor credits
- No lyrics for vocal tracks
- Generic artist bio
- Low-resolution artwork
- Missing genre information

**Why It Fails**: As of January 2025, contributor credits and lyrics are mandatory. Incomplete metadata disqualifies releases.

**The Fix**:
- Complete all contributor fields (Writers, Performers, Production)
- Upload lyrics for ALL vocal content
- High-resolution artwork (2400 x 2400 pixels)
- Detailed, professional metadata

**Source**: [Symphonic Blog - New Apple Music Requirements](https://blog.symphonic.com/2024/08/01/new-apple-music-requirements-for-artists-2/)

**5. Not Following Platform Guidelines**

**The Mistake**:
- Ignoring distributor submission requirements
- Incorrect file formats
- Missing deadline requirements
- Incomplete promotional materials

**Why It Fails**: Every platform has specific rules. Non-compliance results in automatic rejection.

**The Fix**:
- Read distributor guidelines thoroughly
- Follow Apple Music technical specifications exactly
- Prepare all materials in advance
- Double-check requirements before submission

**Source**: [iMusician - Playlist Submission Mistakes](https://imusician.pro/en/resources/blog/playlist-submission-mistakes)

**6. Unrealistic Genre Targeting**

**The Mistake**:
- Pitching indie rock to hip-hop playlists
- Targeting playlists with completely different vibes
- Not researching playlist content

**Why It Fails**: Editorial teams instantly reject genre mismatches.

**The Fix**:
- Research target playlists thoroughly
- Match your sound to appropriate playlists
- Be honest about your genre classification
- Target realistic playlist tiers (don't expect New Music Daily immediately)

**Source**: Industry best practices from multiple sources

**7. Weak Artist Profile and Presence**

**The Mistake**:
- Unclaimed Apple Music for Artists profile
- No artist bio or outdated information
- Low-resolution or missing artist image
- No social media links
- Inconsistent branding

**Why It Fails**: Editorial teams check artist profiles. Weak presentation suggests unprofessionalism.

**The Fix**:
- Claim and fully optimize Apple Music for Artists profile
- Professional artist photography (2400 x 2400 pixels)
- Compelling biography with keywords
- Consistent branding across all platforms
- Regular profile updates

## Final Notes

**Last Updated**: October 2025
**Research Confidence**: High for official Apple policies, Medium for specific distributor capabilities
**Recommended Action**: Artists should directly contact their distributor to confirm Apple Music Pitch access

**Key Takeaway**: Apple Music editorial playlisting for independent artists is 100% dependent on distributor relationships. Unlike Spotify, there is NO direct artist submission portal. Success requires:
1. Choosing a distributor with Apple Music Pitch access
2. Following strict metadata and timing requirements
3. Building organic momentum and engagement
4. Maintaining a professional Apple Music for Artists profile
5. Allowing 10+ days for editorial review

**This research represents current best practices as of October 2025. Always verify requirements directly with your distributor and monitor official Apple Music channels for updates.**
