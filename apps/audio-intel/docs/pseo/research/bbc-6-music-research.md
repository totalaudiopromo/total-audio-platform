- BBC Introducing guarantee 6-month listening window

**Release Planning:**

- Plan submission well in advance of release
- Factor in 6-month listening guarantee
- Allow time for potential playlist consideration

### Submission Quality Standards

**Must-Haves:**

-  Finished, radio-ready production
-  Professional recording quality
-  Final takes only (no demos or rough mixes)
-  First 30 seconds must be compelling
-  Complete artist bio with context

**Avoid:**

-  Unfinished lyrics or out-of-tune instruments
-  Poor quality recordings or demos
-  Submitting before track is ready
-  Generic or incomplete artist bio
-  Bold claims like "this will be the next big hit"

## Common Mistakes Artists Make

### 1. Timing Errors

- **Mistake**: Submitting too close to release date
- **Solution**: Submit 3-6 months in advance

### 2. Quality Issues

- **Mistake**: Submitting unfinished or poorly recorded tracks
- **Solution**: Only submit radio-ready, professionally produced music

### 3. Poor First Impression

- **Mistake**: Weak first 30 seconds (often all that gets heard initially)
- **Solution**: Ensure first 30 seconds are compelling and representative

### 4. Incomplete Information

- **Mistake**: Leaving artist bio empty or generic
- **Solution**: Complete detailed bio - gives presenters context and talking points

### 5. Generic Pitching

- **Mistake**: Self-promotional claims, full biography, award lists
- **Solution**: Focus on music quality and genuine artist story

### 6. Ignoring Guidelines

- **Mistake**: Not following BBC Introducing submission rules
- **Solution**: Follow 2-tracks-per-month limit and complete all required fields

### 7. Wrong Genre Targeting

- **Mistake**: Submitting music that doesn't fit 6 Music's alternative/indie focus
- **Solution**: Research shows and ensure your genre aligns with station identity

### 8. Lack of Strategic Thinking

- **Mistake**: Uploading both tracks randomly instead of strategically
- **Solution**: Use first upload for most radio-ready single, second to show creative breadth

## Pain Points for Indie Artists Pitching 6 Music

### 1. Volume of Submissions

- **Problem**: Too many submissions for individual feedback
- **Reality**: No guarantee of play even with quality submission
- **Workaround**: Use BBC Introducing system for guaranteed listening

### 2. 6-Month Listening Window

- **Problem**: Long wait time for BBC Introducing submissions
- **Reality**: Need to plan releases far in advance
- **Workaround**: Submit early, use time for other promotion

### 3. Limited Direct Contact

- **Problem**: Difficult to reach presenters directly
- **Reality**: BBC policy and presenter workload limits direct contact
- **Workaround**: Focus on BBC Introducing route, build relationships via Fresh On The Net

### 4. Genre Confusion

- **Problem**: Artists unsure if their music fits 6 Music
- **Reality**: Station has broad alternative focus but not everything fits
- **Workaround**: Listen to shows regularly, understand presenter preferences

### 5. Regional Bias

- **Problem**: Postcode determines BBC Introducing regional team
- **Reality**: Strong regional submission can still reach national shows
- **Workaround**: Ensure music quality regardless of location

### 6. Two-Track Monthly Limit

- **Problem**: Only 2 uploads per month feels restrictive
- **Reality**: Forces strategic thinking about best material
- **Workaround**: Choose most radio-ready and creative breadth tracks

### 7. No Feedback Loop

- **Problem**: Artists don't know why tracks weren't selected
- **Reality**: Volume makes individual feedback impossible
- **Workaround**: Focus on quality, study played tracks, refine approach
