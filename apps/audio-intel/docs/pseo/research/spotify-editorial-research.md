## Common Mistakes Artists Make

### 1. Submitting Too Late (MOST COMMON)

- **Mistake**: Pitching less than 7 days before release, or only 7-14 days
- **2025 Reality**: Independent artists without label support need 28+ days
- **Impact**: Curators don't have time to review thousands of weekly submissions
- **Source**: [Hypebot 2025 Guide](https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2025/07/guide-to-get-on-spotify-editorial-playlist-in-2025.html)

### 2. Incomplete or Poorly-Crafted Pitches

- **Mistake**: Full biographies, award lists, or generic one-liners
- **Examples of bad pitches**: "This will be the next big hit" or just "Check out my song"
- **Impact**: Signals lack of effort, immediate rejection
- **Source**: [iMusician Mistakes Guide](https://imusician.pro/en/resources/blog/playlist-submission-mistakes)

### 3. Incorrect Genre/Metadata Tagging

- **Mistake**: Choosing multiple genres to "widen chances" or mislabelling genre
- **Reality**: Top reason for editorial curator rejection
- **Impact**: Track routed to wrong curators or ignored entirely
- **Source**: [iMusician Guide](https://imusician.pro/en/resources/blog/playlist-submission-mistakes)

### 4. Not Providing Enough Detail

- **Mistake**: Leaving submission form fields blank or incomplete
- **Impact**: Curators have no context to understand where track fits
- **Best Practice**: Fill every field accurately - mood, genre, instrumentation, language
- **Source**: [Spotify for Artists](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/pitching-music-to-playlist-editors/)

### 5. Pitching Already Released Music

- **Mistake**: Trying to pitch tracks that are already live on Spotify
- **Reality**: Submission tool only works for unreleased tracks
- **Impact**: Impossible to pitch post-release - option disappears
- **Source**: [Spotify Editorial Guide](https://artists.spotify.com/en/playlisting)

### 6. Neglecting Artist Profile and Online Presence

- **Mistake**: Incomplete Spotify profile (no bio, image, banner) or no social campaign
- **Reality**: Curators check artist profile and social media
- **Impact**: Indicates artist not serious about career, reduces placement chances
- **Required**: Profile image, banner, bio, Canvas, Artist Pick
- **Source**: [iMusician Mistakes](https://imusician.pro/en/resources/blog/playlist-submission-mistakes)

### 7. Sarcastic or Incorrect Information

- **Mistake**: Jokes or sarcasm in submission form, deliberately wrong metadata
- **Impact**: Immediate disqualification, damages artist credibility

- **Ideal**: 28+ days before release for independent artists
- **Minimum**: 7 days (only gets you Release Radar, not editorial consideration)

### Pitch Content

- **Tell the story**: What's the song about, what does it mean to you

- **Describe the vibe**: Clear genre and mood description
- **Keep it concise**: 500 character limit, make every word count
- **Be specific**: Fill every metadata field accurately

### Profile Optimisation

- **Complete profile**: Image, banner, bio, Canvas artwork, Artist Pick
- **Build following**: Encourage fans to follow your Spotify profile
- **Show campaign**: Social media posts, engagement strategy, promotional plans
- **Professional presence**: Consistent branding across platforms

### What NOT to Do

-  Don't write full biographies or list every award

## Contact Discovery Methods (That Actually Work)

### Official Method (ONLY Way for Editorial Playlists)

- **Spotify for Artists**: The only submission method for editorial playlists
- **No direct email**: Cannot email Spotify curators directly
- **Equal access**: All artists have same opportunity via official tool
- **Source**: [Spotify Support](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/pitching-music-to-playlist-editors/)

### For Independent Curator Playlists (NOT Editorial)

- **Playlist descriptions**: Check for contact info or submission links
- **Search method**: Search '@hotmail.com' or 'gmail.com' in Spotify search bar → check Playlists
- **Genre search**: Search "genre, submissions" (e.g., "lofi, submissions")
- **External research**: Google curator names, check Instagram/Twitter/LinkedIn
- **Website submissions**: Many independent curators have submission forms
- **Source**: [Soundcamps Contact Guide](https://soundcamps.com/blog/how-to-contact-spotify-playlist-curators/)

### Tools and Services

- **SubmitHub**: Third-party platform for independent curator pitching (not editorial)
- **Playlist Push**: Paid service connecting artists to independent curators
- **PlaylistPushers**: Directory of independent playlist contacts
- **Note**: These do NOT work for Spotify editorial playlists
- **Source**: [Various third-party services](https://soundcamps.com/blog/best-spotify-pitching-service/)

## Artist Pain Points (Documented Frustrations)

### Time and Research Burden

- **Finding curators**: Hours searching for genre-appropriate playlists
- **Contact discovery**: Difficulty finding submission channels for independent playlists
- **Submission tracking**: No centralised system to track which playlists pitched
- **Follow-up**: No confirmation or feedback from Spotify editorial

### Process Confusion

- **Editorial vs Independent**: Confusion about which playlists are editorial (can't email) vs independent (can contact)
- **Submission windows**: Understanding optimal timing (7 days minimum vs 28 days realistic)
- **Genre matching**: Identifying which playlists match specific subgenres
- **Metadata requirements**: Understanding what information curators actually need

### Rejection and Lack of Feedback

- **No confirmation**: Never know if pitch was reviewed
- **No feedback**: Can't improve for next release
- **One shot only**: Can't re-pitch after release
- **Opaque process**: No insight into selection criteria

### Profile and Presence Requirements

- **Social proof needed**: Curators check social media and artist profile
- **Campaign requirement**: Expected to have promotional strategy in place
- **Professional presentation**: Need complete profile, branding, content
- **Chicken and egg**: Need streams to get playlisted, need playlists to get streams

### Independent Curator Outreach Challenges

- **Contact discovery**: Finding actual email addresses or submission channels
- **Personalisation time**: Each curator pitch needs customisation
- **Hit rate**: Low response rates from independent curators
- **Scams and bots**: Difficulty identifying legitimate vs fake playlists
