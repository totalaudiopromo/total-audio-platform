## Common Mistakes Artists Make

### 1. Sending Audio File Attachments Instead of Web-Links
- **Mistake**: Artists email MP3/WAV attachments to selfreleased@absoluteradio.co.uk
- **Reality**: Absolute Radio explicitly requests WEB-LINK ONLY (Dropbox/SoundCloud) - attachments create email issues and may be rejected
- **Solution**: Upload track to Dropbox or SoundCloud, send link (not attachment) to selfreleased@absoluteradio.co.uk
- **Source**: Absolute Radio Sunday Night Music Club submission guidelines

### 2. Wrong Genre Expectations
- **Mistake**: Sending metal, electronic, hip-hop, or commercial pop to alternative/indie station
- **Reality**: Absolute Radio plays "Coldplay to Foo Fighters, Beatles to Bon Jovi" - alternative, indie, rock for 25-44 demographic
- **Solution**: Only submit if your music genuinely fits alternative/indie/rock genre spectrum
- **Source**: Station format and target demographic

### 3. Expecting Multiple Tracks Featured
- **Mistake**: Artists expect all submitted tracks to be played or multiple tracks featured simultaneously
- **Reality**: Sunday Night Music Club features ONE track per month - highly competitive selection
- **Solution**: Submit your strongest single, accept competitive nature of selection process
- **Source**: Sunday Night Music Club submission guidelines

### 4. Targeting Main Playlist Without Sunday Night Music Club First
- **Mistake**: Trying to approach Dave Berry (Breakfast) or main presenters without Sunday Night Music Club track record
- **Reality**: Sunday Night Music Club is the official route for self-released artists - main playlist requires professional plugging or proven success
- **Solution**: Start with Sunday Night Music Club, build credibility, then consider professional radio campaign
- **Source**: Absolute Radio unsigned/self-released artist pathway

### 5. Poor Quality Recordings
- **Mistake**: Submitting low-quality demos or bedroom recordings
- **Reality**: Absolute Radio is professional station competing with major label releases - requires broadcast-quality audio
- **Solution**: Invest in professional recording/mixing/mastering before submitting (submission guidelines request "best quality")
- **Source**: Radio broadcast quality standards

### 6. Over-Complicated Artist Information
- **Mistake**: Sending lengthy biography, press releases, multiple links, excessive information
- **Reality**: Sunday Night Music Club requests "brief info" - Danielle Perry reviews many submissions, concise information stands out
- **Solution**: Keep email brief: artist name, track title, genre, 2-3 sentence description, essential links only
- **Source**: Sunday Night Music Club submission efficiency

**Hour 10-12**: Planning submission strategy

## Notes for Page Generation

**Hero Intro Callout:**
"Absolute Radio has a clear submission route for self-released artists - Danielle Perry's 'Sunday Night Music Club' at selfreleased@absoluteradio.co.uk. But artists waste 10+ hours discovering CRITICAL details: web-link ONLY (Dropbox/SoundCloud, NOT attachments), brief info required, ONE track per month featured. Audio Intel provides these verified requirements in 2 minutes, preventing rejected submissions and format mistakes."

**Campaign Context:**
Absolute Radio targets 25-44 demographic with alternative/indie/rock music ("Coldplay to Foo Fighters, Beatles to Bon Jovi" range). Self-released artists have a VERIFIED submission route via Sunday Night Music Club, but the requirements are specific: web-link only, best quality audio, brief information, competitive selection (ONE track per month featured). Manual research takes 10-12 hours to discover these critical details; Audio Intel reveals them in 2 minutes.

**Proof Points:**
- 10-12 hours manual research vs 2 minutes Audio Intel processing
- 98% confidence score for Sunday Night Music Club route
- Verified submission email: selfreleased@absoluteradio.co.uk
- **CRITICAL**: Web-link ONLY (Dropbox/SoundCloud), NOT attachments
- Competitive reality: ONE track per month featured
- Genre fit: Alternative/indie/rock "Coldplay to Foo Fighters" range for 25-44 demographic

**Unique Pain Points:**
Self-released artists send audio file attachments to Absolute Radio when web-links are explicitly required (Dropbox/SoundCloud). They submit lengthy biographies when "brief info" is requested. They expect multiple tracks to be featured when only ONE per month is selected. They target Dave Berry's breakfast show without Sunday Night Music Club track record. They send wrong genres (metal, electronic, hip-hop) to alternative/indie station. Audio Intel prevents these submission mistakes with verified format requirements and realistic selection expectations.
