## Common Mistakes Artists Make

### 1. Sending Music to General Kerrang Email Address
- **Mistake**: Artists send demos to general Kerrang Radio contact email expecting Fresh Blood consideration
- **Reality**: Kerrang Radio explicitly states submissions to general email will be DELETED - must use Alex Baker's personal website
- **Solution**: Only submit via Alex Baker's personal website - do NOT use general Kerrang contact emails
- **Source**: Kerrang Radio submission policy, Alex Baker's Fresh Blood show information

### 2. Wrong Genre Expectations
- **Mistake**: Sending pop, indie, folk, or electronic music to rock/metal specialist station
- **Reality**: Kerrang Radio exclusively plays rock, metal, alternative, and punk music
- **Solution**: Only approach Kerrang if your music genuinely fits rock/metal/alternative/punk genres
- **Source**: Station format and 40+ years rock radio history

### 3. Targeting Main Playlist Before Fresh Blood
- **Mistake**: Trying to approach Loz Guest (Head of Music) or main presenters without Fresh Blood track record
- **Reality**: Fresh Blood is the official route for unsigned artists - main playlist requires professional plugging or Fresh Blood success
- **Solution**: Start with Alex Baker's Fresh Blood, build from there
- **Source**: Kerrang Radio unsigned artist pathway

### 4. Poor Recording Quality
- **Mistake**: Submitting low-quality demos or bedroom recordings
- **Reality**: Kerrang Radio is professional rock station with high audio standards - poor quality recordings will be rejected
- **Solution**: Invest in professional recording/mixing/mastering before submitting to radio
- **Source**: Radio broadcast quality standards

### 5. No Engagement with Kerrang Community
- **Mistake**: Cold submission without any engagement with Kerrang Radio or rock music community
- **Reality**: Kerrang values authentic rock/metal artists embedded in the scene
- **Solution**: Engage with Kerrang social media, attend rock/metal gigs, build genuine presence in rock community before submitting
- **Source**: Rock music scene networking practice

## Notes for Page Generation

**Hero Intro Callout:**
"Kerrang Radio has a clear submission route for unsigned rock/metal artists - Alex Baker's 'Fresh Blood' show (Wednesday midnight, 445,000 weekly listeners). But artists waste 10+ hours discovering the CRITICAL detail: general Kerrang emails will be DELETED, you MUST use Alex Baker's personal website. Audio Intel provides this verified route in 2 minutes, preventing wasted submissions and email deletions."

**Campaign Context:**
Kerrang Radio is the UK's specialist rock/metal station with 40+ years history and 445,000 weekly listeners. Unsigned rock artists have a VERIFIED submission route via Alex Baker's Fresh Blood show, but the process is specific and unforgiving: submit via his personal website ONLY or your music will be deleted. Manual research takes 10-12 hours to discover this critical detail; Audio Intel reveals it in 2 minutes.

**Proof Points:**
- 10-12 hours manual research vs 2 minutes Audio Intel processing
- 98% confidence score (highest of all 4 stations researched)
- Verified submission route: Alex Baker's Fresh Blood show via his website
- 445,000 weekly listeners (March 2025 verified data)
- **CRITICAL**: General Kerrang email = DELETED submission

**Unique Pain Points:**
Unsigned rock artists send demos to general Kerrang Radio email addresses, believing they'll reach Alex Baker's Fresh Blood show. Their submissions are automatically deleted. They waste hours searching for presenter contact details when the only valid route is Alex Baker's personal website. They confuse main playlist targeting (requires professional plugging) with Fresh Blood targeting (unsigned artist-focused). Audio Intel prevents these costly mistakes with verified submission intelligence.
