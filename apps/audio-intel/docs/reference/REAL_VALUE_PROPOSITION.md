# AUDIO INTEL - REAL VALUE PROPOSITION

**Last Updated**: October 4, 2025
**Status**: Post-truthfulness audit

##  WHAT AUDIO INTEL IS NOT

- **NOT a contact discovery tool** - you can't input "BBC Radio 1" and get contacts
- **NOT a magic contact finder** - you can't upload just station names/genres
- **NOT a replacement for initial research** - users must find basic emails first
- **NOT a screenshot/Notion export parser** - CSV with emails only

##  WHAT AUDIO INTEL ACTUALLY DOES

### Core Function

**Enriches existing email addresses with current music industry intelligence**

### User Journey (TRUTHFUL)

1. **User finds basic contact emails** via:
   - Google searches (e.g., "BBC Radio 1 contact email")
   - Station websites (general info@ emails)
   - LinkedIn searches for presenters
   - Industry databases they already have access to
   - Old spreadsheets from previous campaigns

2. **User uploads CSV** containing:
   - Contact names
   - **Email addresses (REQUIRED)**
   - Optional: station/platform names, genres, notes

3. **Audio Intel enriches** by researching:
   - Current presenter assignments (people change shows frequently)
   - Verified submission routes (email vs. web form vs. BBC Introducing Uploader)
   - Submission requirements (clean versions, link format, timing)
   - Genre fit analysis (which shows match your music)
   - Presenter changes since last campaign

4. **User receives enriched data** with:
   - Verified emails still work
   - Current show schedules (e.g., "Scott Mills moved to Radio 2 breakfast Jan 2025")
   - Submission preferences (e.g., "web-link ONLY, NO attachments")
   - Genre matching (e.g., "Kenny Allstar = rap/grime, Eddie Kadi = Afrobeats")
   - Critical warnings (e.g., "general emails DELETED at Kerrang")

##  THE REAL VALUE

### Time Savings

- **Before**: 10-18 hours manually verifying contacts, checking websites, finding current presenters
- **After**: 2-15 minutes uploading CSV, waiting for enrichment
- **Savings**: 15+ hours per campaign

### Accuracy Improvements

- **Before**: Outdated presenter info, wrong submission routes, missed requirements
- **After**: Current data (verified within 6 months), correct submission methods, flagged requirements
- **Result**: Higher response rates, fewer bounced emails, no wasted pitches

### What Users Actually Save Time On

1. **Verifying emails still work** - stops bounces before sending
2. **Finding current presenter assignments** - people change shows constantly
3. **Discovering submission requirements** - buried in FAQ pages/submission guidelines
4. **Identifying correct submission routes** - email vs web form vs third-party platforms
5. **Genre matching to shows** - which presenters actually play your music type
6. **Catching policy changes** - e.g., Apple Music mandatory credits from Jan 2025

##  ACCURATE POSITIONING

### Who It's For

- **Radio promoters** who have contact lists but need to verify/update them
- **Independent artists** who've found some emails but need submission intel
- **PR agencies** who inherited client databases needing current verification

### What They Must Have First

- Basic email addresses (even if outdated/general)
- Contact names (even if incomplete)
- Some indication of station/platform

### What They Get

- **Verified** current contact information
- **Enriched** submission requirements and preferences
- **Updated** presenter assignments and show schedules
- **Validated** email addresses that actually work
- **Context** for each contact (genre fit, submission timing, critical warnings)

##  PROVEN USE CASES

### 1. Outdated Database Refresh

**Input**: 200 radio contacts from 2023 campaigns (many outdated)
**Process**: Upload CSV, Audio Intel checks current presenter assignments
**Output**: 156 still valid, 44 flagged as changed shows, 18 emails bouncing

### 2. General Email → Specific Route

**Input**: info@absoluteradio.co.uk (general station email)
**Process**: Audio Intel enriches with submission guidelines
**Output**: selfreleased@absoluteradio.co.uk (correct email), web-link ONLY requirement, Sunday Night Music Club show details

### 3. Presenter Change Detection

**Input**: CSV with "Scott Mills, BBC Radio 1, breakfast show"
**Process**: Audio Intel checks current assignments (Jan 2025)
**Output**: "Scott Mills moved to BBC Radio 2 breakfast (Jan 2025), Radio 1 breakfast now Greg James"

### 4. Submission Route Discovery

**Input**: BBC Radio 1Xtra general contact emails
**Process**: Audio Intel researches submission policies
**Output**: "BBC Introducing Uploader ONLY - no direct presenter contact accepted, general emails ignored"

##  WHAT WE DON'T (CAN'T) DO

1. **Find emails from nothing** - need at least basic contact info to start
2. **Parse screenshots or Notion exports** - CSV with emails only
3. **Accept just station names** - "BBC Radio 1" input alone won't work
4. **Discover playlist curator contacts** - need curator emails to enrich
5. **Scrape contacts from scratch** - enrichment, not discovery

##  WHAT WE SHOULD MARKET

### Hero Headline (CURRENT - ACCURATE)

"Turn email addresses into detailed music industry profiles"

### Actual Value Prop

"Stop wasting 15+ hours verifying outdated contacts. Upload your basic email list, get current presenter assignments, verified submission routes, and critical requirements in minutes."

### Real Customer Problem Solved

"I have a spreadsheet of radio contacts from last year's campaign, but I don't know which presenters changed shows, which emails still work, or what the current submission requirements are."

### NOT What We Should Market

-  "Find any music industry contact instantly"
-  "Upload anything and get contacts back"
-  "Discover hidden music industry emails"
-  "Magic contact finder for radio promoters"

##  HOMEPAGE VALUE PROP AUDIT

**Current homepage text (line 268):**
 "Audio Intel uses AI to turn email addresses into detailed music industry profiles"

**Assessment**: ACCURATE - correctly states you need email addresses to start

**Recommendation**: Keep this positioning, emphasize:

1. Enrichment of existing contacts
2. Verification of outdated databases
3. Current presenter assignment updates
4. Submission requirement discovery

##  PRODUCT REALITY VS MARKETING CLAIMS

### Reality Check Matrix

| Marketing Claim                            | Product Reality                 | Verdict |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------- |
| "Transform email lists into intelligence"  |  Enriches CSVs with emails    | TRUE    |
| "Upload anything"                          |  CSV with emails only         | FALSE   |
| "Input station name + genre"               |  Needs actual email addresses | FALSE   |
| "Upload playlist URLs"                     |  Needs curator emails         | FALSE   |
| "Turn basic emails into detailed profiles" |  Accurate description         | TRUE    |
| "Verify outdated contact databases"        |  Actually does this           | TRUE    |
| "Find current presenter assignments"       |  Actually does this           | TRUE    |

##  THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION

**"If users need emails to use Intel, what's the value?"**

### The Answer

Users don't struggle to find **basic** emails (info@station.com, presenter@bbc.co.uk).
They struggle to:

1. Verify those emails still work
2. Find the **correct** submission email (not general inbox)
3. Know current presenter assignments
4. Discover submission requirements
5. Understand which contacts fit their genre

**Audio Intel bridges the gap between "I have a basic email" and "I know exactly how to pitch this contact effectively."**

##  RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

1.  DONE: Fix all false PSEO claims about station name inputs
2.  DONE: Verify homepage accurately represents product
3. ⏭ TODO: Update demo video to show realistic workflow (CSV upload with emails)
4. ⏭ TODO: Create "How to find basic emails first" guide
5. ⏭ TODO: Add "Where users get emails before using Intel" section
6. ⏭ TODO: Consider building actual contact discovery as separate paid feature

---

**Bottom Line**: Audio Intel is a **contact enrichment** tool, not a **contact discovery** tool. Market it truthfully as what it actually is - a time-saving verification and enrichment system for existing contact lists.
