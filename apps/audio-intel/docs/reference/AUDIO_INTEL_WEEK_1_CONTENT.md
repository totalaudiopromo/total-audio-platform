🎵 MUSIC INDUSTRY INSIGHT MONDAY 🎵2

Stop wasting your weekends researching radio contacts.

Here's what I learned after 5 years in music PR:

1/ 94% of your research time is spent on outdated info
Only 6% of contacts actually work
That's 14+ hours of wasted effort every week

2/ Generic outreach gets you nowhere
Personalized pitches work 300% better
But you need accurate contact intel first

3/ The average indie artist spends 780 hours annually on research
That's 32+ days of work
Time you could spend creating music

4/ Most artists don't know where to find current contacts
They're using outdated databases and Google searches
Missing the platforms where music professionals actually hang out

5/ The solution? Audio Intel automates this in 2 minutes
Get 94% accurate contact intelligence
Stop wasting your time
Focus on what matters: your music
