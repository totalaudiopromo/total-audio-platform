# The Hidden Cost of Manual Contact Research in Music Promotion

After 5+ years in music PR, I discovered that artists and agencies spend 15+ hours weekly on contact research alone.

Here's what I learned:

## The Problem

• Only 6% of contacts are actually reachable
• Response rates drop 80% with generic outreach
• Time spent researching = time not spent creating

## The Solution

Audio Intel analyzes each contact and provides:
• Station/platform information
• Coverage areas and audience reach
• Contact preferences and submission guidelines
• Genre focus and artist types they work with
