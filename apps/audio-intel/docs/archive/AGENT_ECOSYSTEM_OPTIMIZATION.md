**Found**: `.agent-os/` with v1.4.1 configured for Claude Code

## 🚀 10X WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Immediate Consolidation (Today)

1. **Activate TDD Agents**- Move from archive to active
2. **Consolidate Radio Promo**- Merge duplicate functionality
3. **Create Agent Launcher**- Single entry point for all agents

### Phase 2: Unified Workflow System (This Week)

1. **Agent OS Integration**- Connect custom agents to Agent OS
2. **TDD-First Development**- Implement TDD workflow by default
3. **Automated Testing Pipeline**- Natural language test generation

### Phase 3: 10X Multipliers (Next Week)

1. **Workflow Automation**- Chain agents for complex tasks
2. **Context Sharing**- Agents share knowledge across sessions
3. **Performance Monitoring**- Track and optimize agent efficiency

## 🛠️ TECHNICAL INTEGRATION STRATEGY

### Agent OS + Custom Agents Bridge

```yaml
# Enhanced .agent-os/config.yml
agents:
  claude_code:
    enabled: true
    custom_agents_path: ./tools/agents/core-agents
    tdd_agents_path: ./tools/agents/tdd
    workflow_orchestrator: ./tools/agents/unified-orchestrator.js
```

### TDD Workflow Integration

```bash
# New unified workflow commands
node unified-orchestrator.js tdd-plan "feature name"    # Plan with TDD
node unified-orchestrator.js tdd-build "feature name"   # Build with tests
node unified-orchestrator.js quick "feature name"       # Quick implementation
```

### Agent Consolidation Map

```
BEFORE (18+ scattered agents):
├── tools/agents/radio-promo/ (15+ files)
├── tools/agents/core-agents/ (18+ files)
├── tools/agents/archive/ (30+ files)

AFTER (Consolidated):
├── tools/agents/active/
│   ├── business/      # SaaS marketing, analytics
│   ├── content/       # Newsletter, social, news
