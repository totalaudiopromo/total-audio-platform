## Demo Flow for Dan (20 Minutes)

### Part 1: The Problem (2 minutes)

**Your setup:**

> "Dan, you're managing 20+ campaigns across radio, press, and playlisting. I know from working Liberty campaigns that you're spending hours every week just keeping your contact list current. Let me show you what I built to solve that exact problem."

### Part 2: Live Demo (5 minutes)

**Show homepage live enrichment:**

1. **Start with Danny Howard** (Liberty-relevant)
   - Click "Enrich Contact"
   - Show the real-time enrichment (2 seconds)
   - **Highlight:** "BBC Radio 1 Dance, Friday 7-9pm, house and techno focus, submissions via BBC Music Introducing"

2. **Click "Try Another →"** to cycle to Pete Tong
   - Show different contact, different submission requirements
   - **Highlight:** "Essential Selection, very selective, only your best work"

3. **Explain the value:**
   > "This is what I was doing manually for 15 hours per campaign. Now it's 15 minutes."

### Part 3: Real Campaign Example (8 minutes)

**Navigate to Case Studies page:**

1. **Show BBC Radio 1 case study**
   - Before: 3 Excel files, 15 hours research, 60% accuracy
   - After: 15 minutes, 100% validated, submission guidelines included

2. **Show Spotify Editorial case study**
   - Before: Generic submissions, no curator data
   - After: 34 targeted contacts, 4-week lead time intelligence

3. **Show Liberty hypothetical** (the big one)
   - 20 hours/week contact maintenance → 2 hours
   - 237 contacts enriched and validated
   - Genre-tagged for artist-specific filtering

**The hook:**

> "Dan, this is what Audio Intel does RIGHT NOW. It solves your contact research problem today."

### Part 4: The Vision (5 minutes)

**Pull up Figma mockup** (you'll create this - 2 hours max):

> "But here's where this goes. Imagine this contact intelligence was just one piece of a platform that automated your entire workflow..."

**Show concepts:**

1. **Multi-campaign dashboard** - All 20+ campaigns visible at once
2. **AI pitch generation** - Personalized mailouts using contact intel
3. **Campaign timeline automation** - Press → Playlisting → Radio scheduling
4. **Automated client reports** - Friday updates write themselves

**The ask:**

> "That's the vision. But first, I want to prove the foundation works. Would you be willing to pilot Audio Intel on 3-5 Liberty campaigns this month? Real campaigns, real data, real ROI measurement?"

## Objection Handling

### "We already have a contact database"

> "Great - let me enrich 10 of your existing contacts right now and show you what's missing. Submission guidelines, timing windows, genre preferences..."

### "This sounds expensive"

> "£19/month. That's 90 minutes of junior staff time. It saves you 20 hours/week. The math is 187:1 ROI."

### "How do I know the data is accurate?"

> "100% success rate on BBC Radio 1, Spotify, and major industry contacts. I use this for my own campaigns. If it's wrong, I'm wasting my own time."

### "What if we need more than contact enrichment?"

> "That's exactly why I showed you the vision. Start with the foundation, prove it works, then we build the rest based on your actual workflow - not my assumptions."
