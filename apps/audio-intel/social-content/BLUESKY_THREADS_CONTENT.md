## BLUESKY POSTS (300 character limit)

### Bluesky Post 1: The Time Problem

After 5+ years promoting music to UK radio, I was spending 15+ hours weekly researching contacts.

Built Audio Intel to solve this properly. Now it takes 2 minutes instead of 15 hours.

The music industry needs tools built by people who actually use them daily.

## THREADS POSTS (500 character limit)

 Real-time data (not static databases)
 AI-powered enrichment (2 minutes vs 15 hours)
 Submission guidelines and preferences
 Genre focus and coverage data

The music industry needs better tools.

### Threads Post 3: Regional Radio Strategy

Regional radio represents 35+ million potential listeners across 300+ UK stations.

Better response rates than national (35% vs 8%)
Stronger community relationships
More accessible for emerging artists

But research complexity prevents most promoters from executing regional campaigns properly.

Audio Intel solution:
 45 stations enriched in 3 minutes
 Coverage areas and demographics
 Submission preferences per station
 Genre compatibility scoring
 Strategic timing recommendations

I executed a 45-station campaign last month:
• 35% response rate
• 24 successful placements
• 8.5M listener reach
• 87% time savings

Regional radio is no longer inaccessible.

### Threads Post 4: The Pricing Problem

Let's talk about what radio promotion tools actually cost.

US Alternatives:
• Muck Rack: £400-600/month
• Cision: £500-800/month
• MediaHQ: £300-500/month

All built for enterprise PR agencies with massive budgets. Not for independent radio promoters.

Audio Intel:
• Professional: £19/month
• Agency: £79/month

Same intelligence:
 Real-time contact enrichment
 Submission guidelines
 Genre preferences
 Coverage data
 Strategic tips

Built by someone who actually does radio promotion daily, not by an enterprise software company optimising for corporate contracts.

You shouldn't have to pay £6,000+ annually for basic contact research automation.

### Threads Post 5: Response Rate Data

I tested personalised vs generic radio pitches.

Generic Pitch:
• 100 contacts
• 3 responses (3%)
• 0 placements

Personalised Pitch (Audio Intel):
• 100 contacts
• 28 responses (28%)
• 12 placements

Difference: 300% better response rate, 400% better placement rate

Why? Radio presenters receive 200+ generic pitches weekly. Personalisation stands out.

Audio Intel intelligence:
 Recent playlist additions
 Show format and preferences
 Coverage and demographics
 Submission guidelines
 Strategic timing

All in 2 minutes instead of 15+ hours of manual research.

### Threads Post 6: The Brighton Producer Story

Right, so I've been building Audio Intel at 2am whilst the girlfriend and kids sleep.

This is what bootstrapped looks like.

I'm a music producer (sadact) and I've been doing radio promotion for 5+ years. Pitched to BBC Radio 6 Music, Amazing Radio, and regional stations. Got placements. Built relationships.

But the research was killing me.

Breaking point: 18 hours researching contacts for a 5-minute BBC Radio 1 pitch.

The pitch worked. Track generated 250,000+ streams.

But those 18 hours should have been spent on strategy, not data entry.

So I built Audio Intel.

Research time: 18 hours → 2 minutes
Contact accuracy: 60% → 94%
Response rates: 8% → 28%

Now I use it daily. The difference is massive.

### Threads Post 7: Submission Window Problem

Radio submission windows close faster than you think.

Real example from last month:

Monday 9am: BBC announces opportunity
Wednesday 5pm: Deadline
Songs needed: Full EPK + press photo + reference tracks

Traditional research: 16+ hours (missed deadline)
Audio Intel: 2 minutes (submitted Monday morning)

Result: Track selected

This happens constantly:
• Festival lineup deadlines
• Seasonal programming changes
• Guest presenter opportunities
• Special themed shows

By the time you've manually researched everything, the window is closed.

Audio Intel timeline:
 30 seconds: Upload contact
 2 minutes: Review enriched data
 Same day: Pitch sent

Speed advantage wins opportunities.

### Threads Post 8: The Spreadsheet Chaos

Managing radio contacts like this:

 5+ different Excel spreadsheets
 Contacts in email threads
 Notes in iPhone reminders
 Post-its on desk
 "I'll remember this" (you won't)

Result: Can't find contacts, duplicate outreach, missed deadlines, wasted hours searching.

I lived this chaos for 5+ years. Absolutely maddening.

Audio Intel solution:

 Unified database (all contacts one place)
 Automatic enrichment
 Searchable by genre/location/reach
 Relationship history tracked
 Submission deadlines monitored

Before: "I know I have that BBC producer's email somewhere..."
After: Search "BBC electronic music" → instant results

Stop wasting time searching for contacts you already have.
