## Template 1: National/BBC Radio Promoters

**Subject**: Your BBC Radio 1 contact research - 15 hours → 2 minutes

Hi [First Name],

I'm Chris Schofield - been promoting music to UK radio (including BBC Radio 1) for 5+ years. Also produce electronic music as sadact.

Quick question: How much time do you spend researching contact details, submission guidelines, and genre preferences for each campaign?

For most radio promoters, it's 15+ hours per campaign. That was my reality until I built a solution.

**Audio Intel**

Transforms basic contact lists into detailed intelligence:

- Current show information and schedules
- Submission guidelines (real-time, not 6-month-old data)
- Genre preferences per presenter
- Preferred submission formats
- Strategic pitching tips

**Real example:**
Last month I enriched 5 BBC Radio 1 contacts. Processing time: 2 minutes. Manual research time saved: 12+ hours. Accuracy: 100% verified.

**Why I'm reaching out:**

After 5+ years pitching to BBC Radio 1, I know exactly what contact intelligence you need for successful placements. I built this because manual research was killing my weekends.

If you're spending 15+ hours per campaign on research, I'd love to show you how Audio Intel can get that down to 2 minutes.

P.S. - I use this tool daily for my own client campaigns. The difference in response rates (8% → 28%) has been significant.

## Template 2: Regional/Independent Radio Promoters

**Subject**: Regional radio research taking too long? Here's a solution

Hi [First Name],

Chris here - music producer and radio promoter based in Brighton.

I noticed you work with regional radio stations. Quick question: How do you currently research regional station contacts?

Most promoters I speak with spend 8-12 hours per campaign just finding:

- Current contact details
- Coverage areas
- Genre preferences
- Submission windows

That's before you've even started pitching.

**The problem with regional research:**

300+ regional stations in UK. Each with different submission processes. Manual research is absolutely maddening.

**Audio Intel solution:**

Built specifically to make regional radio research manageable:

- Coverage area and listener demographics
- Submission windows and preferences
- Genre focus and programming style
- Recent playlist additions
- Strategic timing recommendations

**Real example:**

Campaign last month: 45 regional stations enriched in 3 minutes. Manual research saved: 16+ hours. Response rate: 35% (vs 8% for generic outreach).

**Why this matters:**

Regional stations have combined reach of 35+ million UK listeners. Better response rates than national stations. Less competitive. Stronger community relationships.

But only if you do the research properly.

**Would you be interested in seeing how this works with your contact lists?**

Happy to jump on a 15-minute call to show you the difference.

P.S. - Built this after spending years manually researching regional stations. Now it takes 2 minutes instead of 16 hours.

## Template 3: Small PR Firms/Agencies (1-5 staff)

**Subject**: Your junior staff spending 15+ hours on contact research?

Hi [First Name],

Chris Schofield here - built Audio Intel after 5+ years promoting music to UK radio.

Quick question about your contact research workflow:

How much time does your team spend researching radio contacts per campaign?

**What I've found with similar-sized agencies:**

Junior staff: 15+ hours per campaign on contact research
Senior staff: 8+ hours verifying and correcting that research
Total: 23+ hours per campaign on data work

That's £1,150+ in staff time per campaign at £50/hour. Plus opportunity cost of slower turnarounds.

**Audio Intel solution for agencies:**

Transform that 23+ hour process into 5 minutes:

- Upload your contact list (30 seconds)
- AI enriches with detailed intelligence (2 minutes)
- Senior staff review enriched data (2 minutes)
- Focus on strategy instead of data entry

**Agency-specific benefits:**

✓ Multi-client support (process multiple campaigns simultaneously)
✓ White-label reports (share intelligence with clients)
✓ Bulk processing (100+ contacts in single upload)
✓ Team collaboration (shared contact database)
✓ Quality control (94% accuracy vs ~60% manual)

**Real ROI calculation:**

Cost: £79/month (Agency plan)
Time saved: 23 hours per campaign × 4 campaigns = 92 hours/month
Value: 92 hours × £50/hour = £4,600/month
ROI: 5,700%

**Would you be open to a 20-minute demo?**

I can show you exactly how this works with your actual contact lists and campaign workflows.

## Template 5: DIY Artists/Self-Promoters

**Subject**: Stop spending your weekends researching radio contacts

Hi [First Name],

Chris here - music producer (sadact) and radio promoter.

Saw you're promoting your own music. Respect. It's hard work.

Quick question: How much time are you spending on radio contact research?

**What I've found with independent artists:**

Weekends spent researching:

- Finding current contact details (4 hours)
- Understanding submission guidelines (3 hours)
- Researching genre preferences (3 hours)
- Verifying contacts still work (2 hours)

Total: 12+ hours per release

**That's time you could spend making music.**

**Audio Intel solution for independent artists:**

Stop spending weekends on research:

- Upload your contact list (1 minute)
- Get detailed intelligence (2 minutes)
- Focus on music creation instead of data entry

**Free plan includes:**

- 10 enrichments per month
- Basic contact intelligence
- Submission guidelines
- Genre preferences

**Paid plan (£19/month):**

- Unlimited enrichments
- Advanced intelligence
- Strategic pitching tips
- Priority support

**Real example:**

Last release I promoted:

- Manual research: 12 hours over weekend
- Audio Intel: 2 minutes on Monday morning
- Extra time for music: 11 hours 58 minutes

**Why I built this:**

I'm a producer first (sadact - electronic music project). I was spending more time researching contacts than making music.

Absolutely maddening.

So I built a tool that gives me those weekends back.

**Want to try it?**

Free plan (no card required): https://intel.totalaudiopromo.com/beta?ref=cold_outreach_diy

10 enrichments free per month. See if it works for your workflow.
