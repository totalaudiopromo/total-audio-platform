# Audio Intel Demo Page - Liberty Music PR Pitch Script

## Opening Pitch (2 Minutes)

**[Show demo page URL on screen]**

"Right, so here's Audio Intel in action. This is specifically designed for music PR professionals like Liberty Music PR.

What you're looking at is the research problem every music promoter faces: you've got a new artist, you need to submit to 50+ radio stations, streaming playlists, and key gatekeepers. Manually researching these contacts? That's 15+ hours per campaign. Just... spreadsheet wrestling.

Audio Intel transforms that into 15 minutes.

You upload your contact list, we enrich it with real intelligence - station contacts, playlist curators, their actual submission preferences, previous campaign response data. Boom. Ready to pitch."

## Demo Walkthrough (3 Minutes)

### Step 1: Show Value Props (30 seconds)

**[Point to the three cards at top]**

"See these three things?

**15 hours → 15 minutes**: That's the time saving per campaign. Real data.

**100% enrichment success**: Every contact we return is verified. BBC Radio 1, Spotify Editorial, major streaming playlist curators. Real people with real email addresses.

**Live industry data**: We're not using outdated contact lists. This is current stuff - BBC, Spotify, key gatekeepers in the music industry right now."

### Step 2: Load Demo Data (15 seconds)

**[Scroll down to "Load Demo Data" button]**

"Let me show you real data. Watch this..."

**[Click "Load Demo Data" button]**

"Loading 5 actual BBC Radio 1 and Spotify Editorial contacts. See the real emails? Real names? This is what you actually get when you enrich your contact list."

**[Wait for demo data to load - about 1.5 seconds]**

"And done. Five industry contacts enriched and ready to pitch."

### Step 3: Show Results (1 minute)

**[Click "Analytics & Export" tab]**

"Now look at the analytics. We've automatically filtered these by confidence:

- **4 High Confidence**: These are your money contacts. Jack Saunders at BBC Radio 1, Nick Grimshaw at BBC 6 Music. People who actively champion new music. You pitch to these first.

- **1 Medium Confidence**: Spotify Editorial. Real contact, but broader team. Good for playlist pitches but you might need multiple attempts.

The system shows you exactly where to focus your energy for the best response rates."

**[Click on one contact card]**

"Each contact has full intelligence:

- Their station/platform
- Their specific music preferences and genres they cover
- Best contact method and timing
- Previous campaign engagement data
- Current project focus

This is what used to take hours of LinkedIn stalking and phone calls. Now it's instant."

### Step 4: Show Integration (45 seconds)

**[Scroll to export options]**

"Three things you can do with enriched contacts:

**1. Export for your team**: CSV for any CRM, Excel for spreadsheet jockeys, professional PDF for client deliverables.

**2. Send to Pitch Generator**: One click, and your enriched contacts flow directly into our Pitch Generator. We write personalised pitches automatically for each contact - proper pitches, not template garbage.

**3. Send to Campaign Tracker**: Manage your entire campaign from submission to follow-up in one place. Track who opened, who replied, response rates by outlet."

**[Click "Send to Pitch Generator" on one contact]**

"This is what happens on a pitch call: we show Liberty Music PR how to take their contact list, enrich it in 15 minutes, generate personalised pitches, and track the whole campaign in real time."

## Objection Handling

### "We already have our contact list"

**Response**: "That's perfect. Audio Intel doesn't replace your existing contacts - it enriches them. We verify they're current, get you their music preferences, track their previous response patterns, and identify the highest-value targets. Essentially, we supercharge what you've already got."

### "Won't this replace our team's research work?"

**Response**: "It replaces the _boring_ part of research - the spreadsheet wrestling. What Audio Intel frees up is time for your team to focus on strategy: which artists are right for which outlets, what stories resonate, building relationships with key gatekeepers. The intelligence work, not the data entry."

### "How do we know the contacts are accurate?"

**Response**: "We verify every contact against multiple sources: LinkedIn, company directories, recent campaign data, artist feedback. We also track response rates, so over time you see exactly which enrichment is working. If a contact doesn't respond, the system flags it. You're never pitching to dead emails."

### "What about privacy/GDPR?"

**Response**: "All our enrichment is based on public industry information and official company directories. No scraping, no spam lists. GDPR compliant, UK-focused data collection. All contact data is encrypted in transit and at rest."

### "Cost vs. manual research"

**Response**: "Manual research for 1 artist across 50 outlets = 15+ hours = £150-300 in labour. Audio Intel is £19/month. You break even on the first artist you enrich. For Liberty Music PR managing dozens of artists, it's a no-brainer ROI."

---

## Closing (30 seconds)

"So here's the deal: Audio Intel turns radio promotion research from a week of work into an afternoon. Your team stops wrestling spreadsheets and starts telling better stories. You can take on more clients, improve your response rates, and focus on what actually builds careers.

We're offering Liberty Music PR a special founder pricing: £19/month forever - that's locked in even when we raise prices next year.

Want to give it a try? We can set you up with a 14-day free trial, show you how to enrich your actual artist contacts, and you'll see exactly how much time it saves your team.

Sound good?"
