            Apple Music has NO direct artist pitching portal like Spotify.

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Apple Music operates a closed editorial system completely different from Spotify&apos;s artist-facing portal. Here are the problems that killed the first attempt.

              <strong className="text-gray-900">Distributor access confusion:</strong> Not all distributors have Apple Music Pitch access. Hours wasted researching which distributors are on Preferred Partners list with actual pitching capabilities.

              <strong className="text-gray-900">Timing requirements stricter:</strong> Apple Music requires 10+ days advance submission (vs Spotify&apos;s 7 days). Artists miss editorial windows by assuming same timeline as Spotify.

            <li>
              <strong className="text-gray-900">New 2025 mandatory requirements:</strong> As of January 2025, all releases require contributor credits (Writers, Performers, Production) and lyrics for vocal content. Releases without these are rejected entirely.
