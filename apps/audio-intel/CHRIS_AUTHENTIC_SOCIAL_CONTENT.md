### Thread 1: The Real Problem
```
After 5 years promoting music for indie artists, I was still spending 15+ hours every week researching radio contacts.

Most of that time was wasted on outdated information.

I built Audio Intel to solve this properly.

Here's what actually works:

1/ Stop using generic databases
They're full of outdated contacts and wrong information. You're better off starting fresh.

2/ Focus on current, active contacts
Look for recent activity, not just contact details. If they haven't posted in 6 months, they're probably not accepting submissions.

3/ Get the details that matter
Station coverage area, submission preferences, genre focus. Generic outreach gets ignored.

4/ Use AI to do the heavy lifting
I built Audio Intel to automate this research. Takes 2 minutes instead of 15 hours.

5/ Focus on relationship building
Once you have good contact intelligence, spend your time on personalized outreach, not data entry.

The music industry needs better tools. Audio Intel is what I wish existed when I started.

### Thread 2: Real Results
```
I just tested Audio Intel on 5 real radio contacts.

Results:
- BBC Radio 1: Enriched with current show info and submission guidelines
- Spotify playlist curator: Found their genre focus and preferred submission format
- Regional radio station: Got coverage area and contact preferences
- Music blogger: Identified their review process and timeline
- Industry professional: Found their current role and submission preferences

All processed in under 2 minutes.

This is what contact research should be. Not spending hours on Google searches and outdated databases.

The tool works because it uses real-time data, not static contact lists.

If you're tired of wasting time on manual research, this is for you.

### Single Post 1: The Time Problem
```
Most indie artists waste 15+ hours weekly on contact research.

That's 780 hours annually.

Time you could spend creating music, building fans, growing your brand.

Audio Intel automates this in 2 minutes.

Stop wasting your weekends on research.
```

### Single Post 2: The Cost Problem
```
US tools like Muck Rack cost £200-500+ per month.

Built for big labels, not indie artists.

Audio Intel: £19.99/month.

Same intelligence, realistic pricing.

The music industry needs tools that work for independent artists.

The Hidden Cost of Manual Contact Research in Music Promotion

After 5+ years promoting music for indie artists and labels, I discovered something frustrating: we were all spending 15+ hours weekly on contact research alone.

Here's what I learned:

THE PROBLEM
Most contact research is wasted effort. You're spending hours finding outdated information, wrong contact details, and submission guidelines that changed months ago.

Only about 6% of the contacts you research will actually be useful. The other 94% is wasted time.

THE REAL COST
15 hours weekly = 780 hours annually. That's 32+ days of work. Time you could spend creating music, building relationships, growing your brand.

Generic outreach gets ignored. You need accurate contact intelligence to write personalized pitches that actually work.

THE SOLUTION
I built Audio Intel to solve this properly. AI-powered contact enrichment that transforms basic email lists into detailed industry intelligence.

Real results:
- 95% reduction in research time
- 300% increase in response rates  
- 15+ hours saved weekly
- 94% contact accuracy

WHAT IT PROVIDES
- Station/platform information
- Coverage areas and audience reach
- Contact preferences and submission guidelines
- Genre focus and artist types they work with
- Strategic tips for effective pitching

Built specifically for UK indie artists and PR agencies who need affordable, effective tools.

### Post 2: The Pricing Problem
```
Why I Built Audio Intel Instead of Using Existing Tools

The music industry has a tool problem.

US-based tools like Muck Rack and Cision cost £200-500+ per month. Built for big labels with massive budgets, not indie artists trying to make it work.

I needed something that:
- Actually worked for UK music industry
- Cost realistic money for independent artists
- Focused on contact intelligence, not enterprise features
- Gave me the details I needed for effective pitching

So I built Audio Intel.

£19.99/month for Professional plan
£39.99/month for Agency plan

Same intelligence, realistic pricing.

The music industry needs tools that work for independent artists, not just major labels.

If you're tired of overpaying for tools that don't fit your needs, give Audio Intel a try.

Built by someone who actually does music promotion, for people who actually do music promotion.
