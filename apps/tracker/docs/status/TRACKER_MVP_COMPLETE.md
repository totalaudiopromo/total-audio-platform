## Technical Fixes

### Campaign Schema (CRITICAL FIX):

```javascript
// REMOVED (old, broken):
- notes (doesn't exist in DB)
- target_metric (wrong name)
- actual_metric (wrong name)

// ADDED (correct schema):
+ genre (Electronic, Indie, Jazz, etc.)
+ target_reach (number of stations/playlists)
+ actual_reach (actual results)
+ status (active, completed, paused)
```

### Files Fixed:

- `components/campaigns/CampaignModal.tsx` 
- `app/page.tsx` (landing + dashboard) 
- `app/demo/page.tsx` (intelligence demo) 
- `lib/intelligence.ts` (benchmark engine)
