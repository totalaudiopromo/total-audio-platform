## 📊 Technical Architecture

### Database Triggers
```sql
-- Auto-calculates on every update
trigger_calculate_intelligence
  → success_rate = (actual_reach / target_reach) * 100
  → cost_per_result = budget / actual_reach
  → performance_score = algorithm vs benchmark
  → percentile_rank = based on performance score
```

### Intelligence Flow
```
1. User creates campaign
2. Database trigger calculates metrics
3. API fetches benchmark data
4. Intelligence engine generates insights
5. UI displays with context
```

### Pattern Recognition
```typescript
analyzePatterns(campaigns[])
  → Genre performance (2+ campaigns)
  → Platform effectiveness (2+ campaigns)
  → Budget optimization (3+ campaigns)
  → Overall success trends
```
