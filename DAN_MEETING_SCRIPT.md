# Liberty Meeting Script - Dan (Managing Director)
**Date**: Tomorrow
**Duration**: 30 minutes
**Your Position**: Radio promoter at Liberty since 2022
**Dan's Position**: Managing Director (started Feb 2025)

---

## 🎯 YOUR GOALS (In Priority Order)

1. **Primary**: Get approval for 2-3 week internal beta test with radio team
2. **Secondary**: Plant seeds for commercial relationship (Liberty as first paying customer)
3. **Tertiary**: Position yourself as strategic asset (not just radio promoter)
4. **Foundation**: Demonstrate you've built real solutions to real problems

---

## 💼 CORE POSITIONING

**Who You Are Today**:
- Radio promoter at Liberty since 2022, working with major clients
- Built legitimate technical skills solving daily workflow problems
- Created 3 production-ready tools that save genuine time

**What You're Offering**:
- Free beta validation period (2-3 weeks) - no risk to Liberty
- Potential long-term commercial relationship that benefits both parties
- First-mover advantage before you sell to other agencies

**Critical Mindset**: You're not asking for permission. You're offering Dan first access to something valuable that you'll sell to Liberty's competitors if they pass.

## 📋 30-MINUTE MEETING STRUCTURE

### **Minutes 0-3: Opening (Set The Frame)**

**Your Opening**:
> "Thanks for making time, Dan. So, I've been building some tools over the last year to solve real workflow problems I face in radio promotion. I've got three working products that genuinely save time - we're talking 6-8 hours reduced to minutes for tasks we do weekly.
>
> I want Liberty to help validate them with a short beta test using the radio team. If they work and save real time, we should talk about what makes sense commercially - whether that's Liberty licensing them internally, becoming a customer, or something else. But first, let me prove they actually work."

**Key Points**:
- ✅ Frame as "already built" not "I want to build"
- ✅ Emphasise real workflow problems, real solutions
- ✅ Introduce commercial framing early but lightly
- ✅ Focus on value to Liberty first

---

### **Minutes 3-12: The Three Tools (Quick Demo)**

**Present in this order** (most impressive first):

#### **1. Audio Intel (Most Impressive - Lead With This)**

**What you say**:
> "First one - Audio Intel. This is contact enrichment. Right now, when we get a new client or campaign, someone spends 6-8 hours researching contacts, finding emails, checking if people are still at that station, validating data.
>
> Audio Intel does that in about 2 minutes. You upload a CSV of contacts or paste names and companies, and it enriches them with current emails, job titles, social profiles, validates they're still active. I've tested it with BBC Radio 1, Spotify, major stations - 100% success rate on real industry contacts."

**Demo Points**:
- Show the actual interface (have it loaded on laptop)
- Upload a sample CSV of 5-10 radio contacts
- Show real-time enrichment happening
- Point out: "This saves 6-8 hours per campaign. If radio team runs 10 campaigns/month, that's 60-80 hours saved monthly."

**Value Statement**:
> "At 60-80 hours saved per month across the team, that's £900-1200 in value monthly at junior researcher rates. Annually, that's £10-15k in time savings."

---

#### **2. Tracker (Most Visual - Second)**

**What you say**:
> "Second tool - Tracker. This one's for campaign reporting and client updates. Right now, we manually track pitches, responses, coverage in spreadsheets or notes. Tracker centralises it all - you log pitches, track responses, see coverage in one dashboard.
>
> More importantly, it generates client reports automatically. What takes 30-45 minutes of copying data into update emails now takes 2 minutes with professional formatting."

**Demo Points**:
- Show dashboard interface
- Create a mock pitch entry (30 seconds)
- Show how client report generates automatically
- Emphasise: "Every campaign needs weekly client updates. If radio team manages 15-20 active campaigns, that's 10-15 hours/week saved on reporting alone."

---

#### **3. Pitch Generator (Least Critical - Third)**

**What you say**:
> "Third one - Pitch Generator. AI-powered pitch writing using Claude. You input artist info, track details, target outlet, and it generates tailored pitches in seconds. Handles tone adjustment for different contacts - casual for indie bloggers, formal for BBC producers.
>
> This one saves maybe 15-20 minutes per pitch compared to writing from scratch. Not massive individually, but when you're writing 20-30 pitches per campaign, it adds up."

**Keep This Brief** - It's the least impressive because AI pitch writing is becoming common. The other two are more unique.

---

### **Minutes 12-15: Quantify The Total Value**

**Bring it together**:
> "So across all three tools, we're looking at:
> - Audio Intel: 60-80 hours saved monthly on contact research
> - Tracker: 40-60 hours saved monthly on client reporting
> - Pitch Generator: 15-20 hours saved monthly on pitch writing
>
> Total: **115-160 hours saved monthly** across the radio team.
>
> At junior researcher equivalent (£15/hr), that's **£1,725-2,400 per month in value**. Annually, that's **£20,700-28,800**.
>
> Compare that to hiring another full-time researcher at £25-30k - these tools deliver similar capacity increase for a fraction of the cost."

---

### **Minutes 15-22: The Ask (Beta + Commercial Framing)**

**Your Proposal**:
> "Here's what I'm proposing:
>
> **Short term (next 2-3 weeks)**: Free beta test with the radio team. No cost to Liberty, just real usage and honest feedback. I want to validate these actually save time in daily workflow, not just in demos.
>
> **Medium term (if beta proves value)**: We talk about commercial terms. I'm building these to sell to PR agencies at £50-200 per month per user - that's industry standard for SaaS tools like this. Liberty could be my first paying customer, which validates the pricing and gives you early access to everything I build.
>
> Why this benefits Liberty:
> - **First-mover advantage**: You get proven tools before competitors
> - **Cost efficiency**: Way cheaper than hiring another researcher (£25-30k salary vs £3-5k tool cost annually)
> - **ROI is clear**: If we're saving 115-160 hours monthly, the value is £20-28k annually. Even at £5k/year cost, that's 75-80% net savings
> - **Potential revenue stream**: You could even white-label these for Liberty's clients - extra revenue opportunity for you"

**Pause here. Let Dan respond.**

---

### **Expected Objections & Your Responses**

#### **Objection 1: "How much would this actually cost?"**

**Your response**:
> "That's what the beta will help determine. Industry standard is £50-200/month per user for tools like this. For Liberty's radio team - let's say 6-8 people - we'd probably look at a team license around £250-400/month, maybe £3-5k annually.
>
> But crucially, if the beta shows you're saving 115-160 hours monthly, the ROI is obvious. £20-28k annual value for £3-5k cost is a no-brainer business decision. And I'm open to discussing what makes sense for Liberty specifically."

---

#### **Objection 2: "We already have tools for this"**

**Your response**:
> "You have tools, but they don't solve these specific workflows. You've got CRMs, email platforms, project management - but nothing that enriches contact data in 2 minutes, or auto-generates client reports from campaign data.
>
> And crucially, if these tools save 115+ hours monthly, the ROI justifies adding them to your stack. It's not about replacing everything - it's about filling workflow gaps that currently take manual time."

---

#### **Objection 3: "Can we just use it free since you built it here?"**

**Your response** (This is critical - handle carefully):
> "The beta is absolutely free to validate it works. But I built these on my own time to solve problems I personally face, and the IP is mine. I'm building this as a business to eventually sell to other PR agencies.
>
> If Liberty finds real value in the beta, I'd love you to be my first paying customer - that validates the pricing model and gives you early access to new features. But I think there's a commercial opportunity here that benefits both of us, and I'd rather discuss fair terms than position it as free forever."

**Stay firm but collaborative here. This is your work, your IP.**

---

#### **Objection 4: "What if we say no after the beta?"**

**Your response**:
> "Totally fine. I'll have validated the tools work, got real user feedback from experienced radio promoters, and can sell to other agencies with that proof. But if Liberty sees ROI from the beta, I'd rather do a deal here first - you're the company I know, and I think we can structure something that works for both parties."

---

### **Minutes 22-25: Development Support (Optional - Only If Dan Shows Interest)**

**If Dan seems engaged and asks about your plans**:
> "I'm also open to discussing development support if Liberty sees strategic value here. That could look like a few different structures:
>
> 1. **Time investment**: Liberty gives me dedicated hours per week to build this professionally (with commercial terms around eventual revenue share)
> 2. **Resource investment**: Some budget to accelerate development - design work, infrastructure, testing
> 3. **Partnership structure**: Liberty gets equity or ownership stake in exchange for funding and first-customer commitment
>
> But honestly, first things first - let's validate it actually works with the beta and saves real time. Then we can talk about what makes sense strategically."

**Only introduce this if Dan seems excited. Don't lead with it.**

---

### **Minutes 25-28: Beta Logistics (If He Says Yes)**

**What you need from Liberty for beta**:
> "If you're open to the beta, here's what I'd need:
>
> 1. **Access**: 3-5 people from radio team willing to use these daily for 2-3 weeks
> 2. **Feedback**: Weekly check-in (15 mins) to get honest feedback on what works/doesn't
> 3. **Data**: Track time saved - even rough estimates ('this used to take 4 hours, now takes 20 minutes')
> 4. **Approval**: Just confirm I can run this beta without it being a compliance issue
>
> What I'll provide:
> 1. **Onboarding**: 30-min training session with the radio team on how to use each tool
> 2. **Support**: I'm around daily anyway, so immediate fixes if something breaks
> 3. **Data report**: End of beta, I'll give you a full report on time saved, productivity impact, team feedback
> 4. **No commitment**: If it doesn't work or save time, we just stop"

---

### **Minutes 28-30: Close**

**Your closing statement**:
> "My ask is simple: Give me 2-3 weeks to prove these tools save real time with the radio team. Free beta, no cost, no commitment.
>
> I'll measure time saved, get honest feedback, and at the end we'll have real data on whether this is worth pursuing commercially. If the beta shows strong ROI - which I believe it will - we discuss commercial terms that work for Liberty. Fair?"

**Pause. Let him respond.**

**If he says yes**:
> "Brilliant. I'll set up the beta access this week and schedule a training session with the radio team. Really appreciate you taking the time to hear this, Dan."

**If he says maybe/needs to think**:
> "Completely understand. What would you need to see or know to feel comfortable approving a beta test? Happy to provide more detail on anything."

**If he says no**:
> "Fair enough. I appreciate your time. If it's alright, I'd love to get your feedback on what the concern is - whether it's timing, resources, or something else. Helps me understand how to position this better."

*(You want to understand the 'no' so you can address it or move on cleanly)*

## 🎯 WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

**Best Outcome**: Dan approves 2-3 week beta, you schedule training with radio team this week

**Good Outcome**: Dan wants more info but is interested, you schedule follow-up with specific details

**Neutral Outcome**: Dan says "let me think about it", you get clarity on timeline for decision

**Learn Outcome**: Dan says no but gives you clear feedback on why (you learn for next pitch)

## 🎤 YOUR AUTHENTIC VOICE REMINDERS

Dan knows you as a radio promoter, so stay **authentic to who you are**:

- **British casual-professional**: "Right, so here's the thing..." / "Tbh, this saves a ridiculous amount of time"
- **Industry insider**: "You know how much time we spend validating contact data..." / "When you're pitching 20-30 contacts per campaign..."
- **Technical but accessible**: Not "I architected a microservices infrastructure", but "I built a tool that connects to APIs and enriches data in real-time"
- **Practical problem-solver**: "I got sick of spending 8 hours on contact research, so I built something to fix it"

**You're not trying to sound like a startup founder pitching VCs. You're a radio promoter who built useful tools. That authenticity is your strength.**

---

## 💪 FINAL PEP TALK

You've spent a year building these tools. They work. They save real time. The ROI is legitimate.

Dan is a Managing Director - he thinks commercially. If you walk in and say "I've built something that saves £20-28k annually in time, and it costs £3-5k to license", that's a simple business decision.

**You're not asking for charity. You're offering first access to something valuable.**

If Liberty says no, other agencies will say yes. But you're giving Dan the chance to be first.

Walk in confident. Demo the value. Ask for the beta. Handle objections professionally. Close with clear next steps.

**You've got this.**

---
