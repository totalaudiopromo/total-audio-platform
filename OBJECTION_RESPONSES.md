# Total Audio Promo - Objection Handling Guide

## Top 10 Liberty Music PR Objections - Prepared Responses

---

## OBJECTION #1: "We already have systems that work"

**Why They Say This:**
- Comfortable with current workflow
- Fear of change/disruption
- Investment in current systems (Google Sheets, purchased databases)

### Response Framework

**Acknowledge → Validate → Reframe → Ask**

**Response:**
"Absolutely - and those systems got Liberty from a kitchen table to offices in three countries, which is incredible. The question isn't whether your current systems work - they clearly do. The question is: **can they scale to your next phase?**

You're managing 40+ freelancers across Brighton, London, and LA, with NY coming. Can shared spreadsheets handle that coordination without version control chaos? And is Sam's time worth more than £30/hour spending 15 hours on contact research?

What if we could **keep what works** (your relationships, your expertise, your process) but **eliminate what drains time** (contact research, pitch drafting, coordination friction)?"

**Then Ask:**
"What specifically about your current systems works well that you want to preserve?"

**Address Their Real Concern:**
- Not forcing them to abandon everything
- Enhancing what works, replacing what wastes time
- Evolution, not revolution

---

## OBJECTION #2: "Too expensive for our scale"

**Why They Say This:**
- Budget concerns
- Comparing to free tools (spreadsheets)
- Unsure of ROI

### Response Framework

**Flip the Script:** It's not an expense, it's a £115k/year saving

**Response:**
"I totally understand budget concerns - especially for an independent agency. Let me show you how this actually **saves** Liberty £115,000 per year, not costs £12,000.

You're running roughly 10 campaigns per month with 40+ freelancers. Each campaign, your team spends:
- 15 hours on contact research (£450 at £30/hour)
- 2.5 hours on pitch writing (£75)
- 20 hours on coordination (£600)
- 4 hours on client reports (£120)

That's **£1,245 per campaign in time costs.** Times 10 campaigns = **£12,450 per month** your team spends on admin work.

Total Audio Promo costs £1,000-2,000/month and gives you back most of that time. You're not spending £12,000/year - you're **saving £115,000/year after costs.**

The question isn't 'can we afford this?' - it's 'can we afford not to?'"

**Then Ask:**
"Would you like to see the detailed ROI calculation?"

## OBJECTION #3: "We don't need AI, we have relationships"

**Why They Say This:**
- Fear AI will replace human connection
- Pride in relationship-building skill
- Misunderstanding of how AI assists (doesn't replace)

### Response Framework

**Agree Strongly → Clarify Misconception → Show Enhancement**

**Response:**
"You're absolutely right - and that's **exactly why Total Audio Promo works.**

Relationships are everything in music PR. Jack Saunders doesn't play a track because an AI pitched him - he plays it because Sam has built trust over years. **AI can't replace that, and shouldn't.**

But here's what AI **can** do: Give Sam back 15 hours per campaign that he currently spends on Google researching contact details. That's 15 hours Sam could spend **building relationships** instead of administrative busywork.

Think about it: Would Sam rather spend 3 hours on Monday researching Jack Saunders' email address, or spend 3 hours on Monday having coffee with Jack and learning what he's looking for next month?

**Total Audio Promo doesn't replace relationships - it creates time for them.**"

**Then Show:**
- Pull up demo: "The AI drafts the pitch, but Sam reviews, edits, adds personal touches before sending. Sam stays in control."

## OBJECTION #4: "What if it doesn't work for our workflow?"

**Why They Say This:**
- Fear of disruption
- Concern about learning curve
- Uncertainty about fit with existing process

### Response Framework

**Validate Fear → De-Risk → Offer Pilot**

**Response:**
"That's the smartest question you could ask - and exactly why I'm **not** asking you to commit to an annual contract today.

Here's what I'm proposing: A **4-week pilot program.**

- Sam and 1-2 team members test it on 2 real campaigns
- If it doesn't fit your workflow, you've spent £500 and learned something
- If it does work, you've discovered a competitive advantage

**Low risk, real-world test, your actual workflow.**

And because I do radio promo work for Liberty, I built this to fit how you already work. It's not forcing a new workflow - it's making your existing workflow faster."

**Then Ask:**
"Does a 4-week pilot sound reasonable to test whether it fits?"

## OBJECTION #5: "Our team won't use it / Learning curve concerns"

**Why They Say This:**
- Past experience with tools no one adopted
- Fear of training time burden
- Concern about freelancer buy-in

### Response Framework

**Acknowledge Past → Show Simplicity → Commit to Support**

**Response:**
"I've seen that problem too - companies buy expensive software, nobody uses it, it dies. That's why Total Audio Promo is designed to be **stupidly simple.**

Watch this: [Do 30-second Audio Intel demo]

Open tool, click BBC Radio, 45 contacts. **That's it.** No 6-week training program. No 400-page manual.

And here's my commitment: I'll personally train Sam's team. Hands-on session, 60 minutes, they'll be up and running. Not weeks - **one hour.**

Why? Because this is built by someone who does your job. Every feature exists because I needed it myself. When tools are built by practitioners for practitioners, they're intuitive."

**Then Offer:**
"How about this: During the pilot, I'll do a 60-minute training session with Sam's team. If after 1 week they're still struggling, we extend the pilot or adjust. Fair?"

---

## OBJECTION #6: "What about data privacy / security?"

**Why They Say This:**
- Protecting valuable contact database
- GDPR compliance concerns
- Fear of data being sold to competitors

### Response Framework

**Take Seriously → Clarify Policy → Provide Documentation**

**Response:**
"Data privacy is critical - especially with GDPR. Let me be crystal clear:

**Your data stays yours.** We don't sell, share, or license your contacts to anyone. Liberty's contact database is Liberty's asset, not ours.

**GDPR compliant:** All data stored in UK/EU servers. You can export or delete your data anytime.

**No data mining:** We're not building a big database from your contacts. We provide the tools, you own the data.

Think of it like Google Docs - Google provides the tool, but your documents are yours. Same model."

**Then Offer:**
"I can provide our full data privacy policy and GDPR compliance documentation. Would you like me to send that over?"

**Note:** Ensure you actually have these documents prepared

## OBJECTION #7: "What if you shut down / go out of business?"

**Why They Say This:**
- Risk of dependency on small startup
- Fear of losing workflow if company fails
- Need for stability

### Response Framework

**Acknowledge Risk → Show Mitigation → Highlight Flexibility**

**Response:**
"That's a fair concern for any startup tool, and I appreciate you thinking long-term.

Here's how we mitigate that risk:

**1. Data export anytime:** All your data (contacts, campaigns, notes) exports to CSV at any time. If we disappear tomorrow, you have everything.

**2. No long-term lock-in:** Pilot program is 4 weeks, then month-to-month option. Not forcing 3-year contracts.

**3. Growing customer base:** Every agency that adopts us makes the business more stable. You won't be the only customer - we're building a sustainable business serving the UK music PR market.

But here's the real question: **What's riskier?**
- Using Total Audio Promo month-to-month with full data export capability, or
- Keeping 40+ freelancers coordinating via shared spreadsheets as you scale to international offices?"

**Then Reframe:**
"The pilot lets you test without major commitment. If we're not stable enough for you, you'll discover that in 4 weeks at minimal cost."

---

## OBJECTION #8: "Can we integrate with our existing tools?"

**Why They Say This:**
- Already using other tools (Mailchimp, Airtable, Asana)
- Don't want disconnected systems
- Need workflow integration

### Response Framework

**Current State → Roadmap → Interim Solution**

**Response:**
"Great question - integration is critical for workflow efficiency.

**Current state:** Campaign Tracker exports to CSV, which integrates with virtually any tool (Excel, Google Sheets, Airtable, Asana).

**Coming soon (Q1 2025 roadmap):**
- Mailchimp integration (sync contacts)
- Airtable integration (push campaign data)
- Gmail integration (send pitches directly from platform)
- Zapier integration (connect to 1000+ tools)

**Here's my ask:** What are your top 3 integration priorities? As an early adopter, Liberty's needs influence our development roadmap. We build what our customers need."

**Then Ask:**
"Which integrations matter most to your workflow? Let me make sure they're on our roadmap."

**Address Their Real Concern:**
- Not forcing them to abandon existing tools
- Building integrations that matter
- Early adopters shape product direction

## OBJECTION #9: "We need to see results before committing"

**Why They Say This:**
- Risk-averse decision-making
- Need proof it works for their specific agency
- Want case studies from similar agencies

### Response Framework

**Agree Completely → Pilot as Proof → Case Study Opportunity**

**Response:**
"I completely agree - and I'm **not** asking you to commit before seeing results. That's exactly what the pilot program is for.

**Here's the pilot structure:**

**4 weeks, 2 campaigns, track these metrics:**
- Time spent on contact research (before vs after)
- Time spent on pitch creation (before vs after)
- Team feedback on usability (does it actually help?)
- Campaign results (same or better placements?)

**Success criteria:** If it doesn't save Sam's team at least 10 hours per campaign, we haven't delivered value.

**After 4 weeks, you decide:** Continue at full price, negotiate based on results, or walk away - no hard feelings.

You're not buying on faith - you're testing with real data."

**Then Offer:**
"And if it works, would you be willing to be a case study? 'How Liberty Music PR Saved 387 Hours Per Month' would be powerful for us - and great PR for you."

## OBJECTION #10: "Budget timing - wrong time of year"

**Why They Say This:**
- Already allocated annual budget
- Budget review cycle is in X months
- Can't add new expense mid-cycle

### Response Framework

**Acknowledge Reality → Flexible Timing → Pilot Now, Contract Later**

**Response:**
"I totally understand - budget cycles are real constraints. Here's how we can work with your timing:

**Option 1: Pilot now, contract later**
- Run the £500 pilot program this month
- Prove ROI with real data
- When your budget cycle comes around, you have hard numbers to justify the full investment

**Option 2: Start small, scale later**
- Start with small tier (£500/month) that fits current budget
- Scale up when next budget cycle opens
- No penalty for starting small

**Option 3: Cost-neutral approach**
- Calculate current time costs (£12,450/month as we discussed)
- Position Total Audio Promo as **cost savings, not new expense**
- Finance teams often allow cost-saving tools outside budget cycle

**The key point:** The pilot costs less than Sam's team wastes in time costs in 2 days. Even if full rollout waits until next budget cycle, you'll have proven the ROI."

**Then Ask:**
"When is your next budget review? Let's align the pilot so you have data ready for that meeting."

## Advanced Objection Handling Techniques

### The "Feel, Felt, Found" Method

**Template:**
"I understand how you **feel**. Other agencies have **felt** the same way. Here's what they **found**..."

**Example (for "too expensive" objection):**
"I understand how you feel about the investment. Other agencies have felt the same way when they first saw the pricing. Here's what they found: After the first month, the time savings paid for the tool 10x over, and they wondered why they didn't start sooner."

---

### The "Boomerang" Technique

Turn their objection into a reason to buy.

**Example (for "our team won't use it"):**
"That's exactly why the pilot program is so valuable. If your team won't use it, you'll discover that in 4 weeks at minimal cost. But if they love it - which I believe they will - you'll have solved a major workflow bottleneck. Either way, you win."

---

### The "Isolation" Technique

Isolate the objection to see if it's the real blocker.

**Template:**
"If we could solve [objection], would you be ready to move forward with the pilot?"

**Example:**
"If we could show you how this integrates with your existing tools, would you be ready to move forward with the 4-week pilot?"

**Purpose:** Reveals if it's the real concern or a smokescreen for deeper hesitation

---

## Objection Priority Matrix

### Tier 1: Deal-Breakers (Address Immediately)

1. Budget / Too expensive
2. Doesn't fit workflow
3. Team won't use it

**Why Critical:** These stop the deal cold if not addressed

**Strategy:** Address proactively in pitch, not just reactively

---

### Tier 2: Legitimate Concerns (Address Thoughtfully)

4. Data privacy/security
5. What if you shut down
6. Integration needs

**Why Important:** Reasonable concerns that need serious answers

**Strategy:** Have documentation ready, show you've thought about this

---

### Tier 3: Hesitation / Risk Aversion (De-Risk)

7. Need to see results first
8. Budget timing
9. Already have systems that work
10. Don't need AI, have relationships

**Why Manageable:** Pilot program addresses most of these

**Strategy:** Pilot program is the answer to 80% of these

---

## When to Walk Away

**Red Flags That Liberty Isn't Ready:**

1. **"We're happy with how things are"** + no acknowledgment of pain points
   → They genuinely don't see the problem. Come back in 6 months.

2. **Multiple stakeholders actively opposed**
   → If Bee and Dan both say no, Sam's enthusiasm won't overcome it.

3. **"We don't have budget and won't for 12+ months"**
   → Timing is wrong. Follow up in 9 months.

4. **"We tried tools like this before and they all failed"**
   → Deep skepticism from past bad experiences. Very hard to overcome.

**How to Walk Away Gracefully:**

"I appreciate your time and honesty. It sounds like timing isn't right for Liberty right now, and that's totally fine. Can I check back in [6 months/when your budget cycle opens/when you've hired that new team member]? In the meantime, I'll send over the ROI document - maybe it'll be useful for future planning."

**Why This Works:**
- Leaves door open
- Shows respect for their position
- Maintains relationship (Chris still works with Liberty)
